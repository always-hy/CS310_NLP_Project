I rise into adult air\nlike a hollyhock, I’m so proud to be loved\nlike this. The air is tight to my nervous body.\nI use new clothes and shoes the way the corn-studded\nsoil around here uses nitrogen, giddily.\nOhio, Ohio, Ohio. Often I sing\nto myself all day like a fieldful of August\ninsects, just things I whisper, really,\na trance in sneakers. I’m learning\nto read from my mother and soon I’ll go to school,\nI hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the air\ngoes slack around my body and I have to hug myself,\na cloud, an imaginary friend, the stream in the road-\nside park. I love to be called for dinner.\nSpot goes out and I go in and the lights\nin the kitchen go on and the dark,\nwhich also has a body like a cloud’s,\nleans lightly against the house. Tomorrow\nI’ll find the sweat stains it left, little grey smudges.\nHere’s a sky no higher than a street lamp,\nand a stack of morning papers cinched by wire.\nIt’s 4:00 A.M. A stout dog, vaguely beagle,\nminces over the dry, fresh-fallen snow;\nand here’s our sleep-sodden paperboy\nwith his pliers, his bike, his matronly dog,\nhis unclouding face set for paper route\nlike an alarm clock. Here’s a memory\nin the making, for this could be the morning\nhe doesn’t come home and his parents\ntwo hours later drive his route until\nthey find him asleep, propped against a street lamp,\nhis papers all delivered and his dirty paper-\nsatchel slack, like an emptied lung,\nand he blur-faced and iconic in the morning\nair rinsing itself a paler and paler blue\nthrough which a last few dandruff-flecks\nof snow meander casually down.\nThe dog squeaks in out of the dark,\nsnuffling me too me too. And here he goes\nhome to memory, and to hot chocolate\non which no crinkled skin forms like infant ice,\nand to the long and ordinary day,\nschool, two triumphs and one severe\nhumiliation on the playground, the past\nalready growing its scabs, the busride home,\ndinner, and evening leading to sleep\nlike the slide that will spill him out, come June,\ninto the eye-reddening chlorine waters\nof the municipal pool. Here he goes to bed.\nKiss. Kiss. Teeth. Prayers. Dark. Dark.\nHere the dog lies down by his bed,\nand sighs and farts. Will he always be\nthis skinny, chicken-bones?\nHe’ll remember like a prayer\nhow his mother made breakfast for him\nevery morning before he trudged out\nto snip the papers free. Just as\nhis mother will remember she felt\nguilty never to wake up with him\nto give him breakfast. It was Cream\nof Wheat they always or never had together.\nIt turns out you are the story of your childhood\nand you’re under constant revision,\nlike a lonely folktale whose invisible folks\nare all the selves you’ve been, lifelong,\nshadows in fog, grey glimmers at dusk.\nAnd each of these selves had a childhood\nit traded for love and grudged to give away,\nnow lost irretrievably, in storage\nlike a set of dishes from which no food,\nno Cream of Wheat, no rabbit in mustard\nsauce, nor even a single raspberry,\ncan be eaten until the afterlife,\nwhich is only childhood in its last\ndisguise, all radiance or all humiliation,\nand so it is forfeit a final time.\nIn fact it was awful, you think, or why\nshould the piecework of grief be endless?\nOnly because death is, and likewise loss,\nwhich is not awful, but only breathtaking.\nThere’s no truth about your childhood,\nthough there’s a story, yours to tend,\nlike a fire or garden. Make it a good one,\nsince you’ll have to live it out, and all\nits revisions, so long as you all shall live,\nfor they shall be gathered to your deathbed,\nand they’ll have known to what you and they\nwould come, and this one time they’ll weep for you.\nThe map in the shopping center has an X\nsigned “you are here.” A dream is like that.\nIn a dream you are never eighty, though\nyou may risk death by other means:\nyou’re on a ledge and memory calls you\nto jump, but a deft cop talks you in\nto a small, bright room, and snickers.\nAnd in a dream, you’re everyone somewhat,\nbut not wholly. I think I know how that\nworks: for twenty-one years I had a father\nand then I became a father, replacing him\nbut not really. Soon my sons will be fathers.\nSurely, that’s what middle-aged means,\nbeing father and son to sons and father.\nThat a male has only one mother is another\nstory, told wherever men weep wholly.\nThough nobody’s replaced. In one dream\nI’m leading a rope of children to safety,\nthrough a snowy farm. The farmer comes out\nand I have to throw snowballs well to him\nso we may pass. Even dreaming, I know\nhe’s my father, at ease in his catcher’s\nsquat, and that the dream has revived\nto us both an old unspoken fantasy:\nwe’re a battery. I’m young, I’m brash,\nI don’t know how to pitch but I can\nthrow a lamb chop past a wolf. And he\ncan handle pitchers and control a game.\nI look to him for a sign. I’d nod\nfor anything. The damn thing is hard to grip\nwithout seams, and I don’t rely only\non my live, young arm, but throw by all\nthe body I can get behind it, and it fluffs\ntoward him no faster than the snow\nin the dream drifts down. Nothing\ntakes forever, but I know what the phrase\nmeans. The children grow more cold\nand hungry and cruel to each other\nthe longer the ball’s in the air, and it begins\nto melt. By the time it gets to him we’ll be\nour waking ages, and each of us is himself\nalone, and we all join hands and go.\nToward dawn, rain explodes on the tin roof\nlike popcorn. The pale light is streaked by grey\nand that green you see just under the surface\nof water, a shimmer more than a color.\nTime to dive back into sleep, as if into\nhappiness, that neglected discipline ....\nIn those sixth-grade book reports\nyou had to say if the book was optimistic\nor not, and everyone looked at you\nthe same way: how would he turn out?\nHe rolls in his sleep like an otter.\nUncle Ed has a neck so fat it’s funny,\nand on the way to work he pries the cap\noff a Pepsi. Damn rain didn’t cool one weary\nthing for long; it’s gonna be a cooker.\nThe boy sleeps with a thin chain of sweat\non his upper lip, as if waking itself,\nbecoming explicit, were hard work.\nWho knows if he’s happy or not?\nA child is all the tools a child has,\ngrowing up, who makes what he can.",

With a heart\nJoyous, nor scared at its own liberty,\nI look about; and should the chosen guide\nBe nothing better than a wandering cloud,\nI cannot miss my way. I breathe again!\nTrances of thought and mountings of the mind\nCome fast upon me: it is shaken off,\nThat burthen of my own unnatural self,\nThe heavy weight of many a weary day\nNot mine, and such as were not made for me.\nLong months of peace (if such bold word accord\nWith any promises of human life),\nLong months of ease and undisturbed delight\nAre mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,\nBy road or pathway, or through trackless field,\nUp hill or down, or shall some floating thing\nUpon the river point me out my course?\nDear Liberty! Yet what would it avail\nBut for a gift that consecrates the joy?\nFor I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven\nWas blowing on my body, felt within\nA correspondent breeze, that gently moved\nWith quickening virtue, but is now become\nA tempest, a redundant energy,\nVexing its own creation. Thanks to both,\nAnd their congenial powers, that, while they join\nIn breaking up a long-continued frost,\nBring with them vernal promises, the hope\nOf active days urged on by flying hours,--\nDays of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought\nAbstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,\nMatins and vespers of harmonious verse!\nThus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make\nA present joy the matter of a song,\nPour forth that day my soul in measured strains\nThat would not be forgotten, and are here\nRecorded: to the open fields I told\nA prophecy: poetic numbers came\nSpontaneously to clothe in priestly robe\nA renovated spirit singled out,\nSuch hope was mine, for holy services.\nMy own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's\nInternal echo of the imperfect sound;\nTo both I listened, drawing from them both\nA cheerful confidence in things to come.\nContent and not unwilling now to give\nA respite to this passion, I paced on\nWith brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,\nTo a green shady place, where down I sate\nBeneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice\nAnd settling into gentler happiness.\n'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,\nWith warmth, as much as needed, from a sun\nTwo hours declined towards the west; a day\nWith silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,\nAnd in the sheltered and the sheltering grove\nA perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts\nEncouraged and dismissed, till choice was made\nOf a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,\nNor rest till they had reached the very door\nOf the one cottage which methought I saw.\nNo picture of mere memory ever looked\nSo fair; and while upon the fancied scene\nI gazed with growing love, a higher power\nThan Fancy gave assurance of some work\nOf glory there forthwith to be begun,\nPerhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,\nNor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,\nSave when, amid the stately grove of oaks,\nNow here, now there, an acorn, from its cup\nDislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once\nTo the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.\nFrom that soft couch I rose not, till the sun\nHad almost touched the horizon; casting then\nA backward glance upon the curling cloud\nOf city smoke, by distance ruralised;\nKeen as a Truant or a Fugitive,\nBut as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,\nEven with the chance equipment of that hour,\nThe road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.\nIt was a splendid evening, and my soul\nOnce more made trial of her strength, nor lacked\nAeolian visitations; but the harp\nWas soon defrauded, and the banded host\nOf harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,\nAnd lastly utter silence! 'Be it so;\nWhy think of anything but present good?'\nSo, like a home-bound labourer, I pursued\nMy way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed\nMild influence; nor left in me one wish\nAgain to bend the Sabbath of that time\nTo a servile yoke. What need of many words?\nA pleasant loitering journey, through three days\nContinued, brought me to my hermitage.\nI spare to tell of what ensued, the life\nIn common things--the endless store of things,\nRare, or at least so seeming, every day\nFound all about me in one neighbourhood--\nThe self-congratulation, and, from morn\nTo night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.\nBut speedily an earnest longing rose\nTo brace myself to some determined aim,\nReading or thinking; either to lay up\nNew stores, or rescue from decay the old\nBy timely interference: and therewith\nCame hopes still higher, that with outward life\nI might endue some airy phantasies\nThat had been floating loose about for years,\nAnd to such beings temperately deal forth\nThe many feelings that oppressed my heart.\nThat hope hath been discouraged; welcome light\nDawns from the east, but dawns to disappear\nAnd mock me with a sky that ripens not\nInto a steady morning: if my mind,\nRemembering the bold promise of the past,\nWould gladly grapple with some noble theme,\nVain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds\nImpediments from day to day renewed.\nAnd now it would content me to yield up\nThose lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts\nOf humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!\nThe Poet, gentle creature as he is,\nHath, like the Lover, his unruly times;\nHis fits when he is neither sick nor well,\nThough no distress be near him but his own\nUnmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased\nWhile she as duteous as the mother dove\nSits brooding, lives not always to that end,\nBut like the innocent bird, hath goadings on\nThat drive her as in trouble through the groves;\nWith me is now such passion, to be blamed\nNo otherwise than as it lasts too long.\nWhen, as becomes a man who would prepare\nFor such an arduous work, I through myself\nMake rigorous inquisition, the report\nIs often cheering; for I neither seem\nTo lack that first great gift, the vital soul,\nNor general Truths, which are themselves a sort\nOf Elements and Agents, Under-powers,\nSubordinate helpers of the living mind:\nNor am I naked of external things,\nForms, images, nor numerous other aids\nOf less regard, though won perhaps with toil\nAnd needful to build up a Poet's praise.\nTime, place, and manners do I seek, and these\nAre found in plenteous store, but nowhere such\nAs may be singled out with steady choice;\nNo little band of yet remembered names\nWhom I, in perfect confidence, might hope\nTo summon back from lonesome banishment,\nAnd make them dwellers in the hearts of men\nNow living, or to live in future years.\nSometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking\nProud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,\nWill settle on some British theme, some old\nRomantic tale by Milton left unsung;\nMore often turning to some gentle place\nWithin the groves of Chivalry, I pipe\nTo shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,\nAmid reposing knights by a river side\nOr fountain, listen to the grave reports\nOf dire enchantments faced and overcome\nBy the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,\nWhere spear encountered spear, and sword with sword\nFought, as if conscious of the blazonry\nThat the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;\nWhence inspiration for a song that winds\nThrough ever-changing scenes of votive quest\nWrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid\nTo patient courage and unblemished truth,\nTo firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,\nAnd Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.\nSometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate\nHow vanquished Mithridates northward passed,\nAnd, hidden in the cloud of years, became\nOdin, the Father of a race by whom\nPerished the Roman Empire: how the friends\nAnd followers of Sertorius, out of Spain\nFlying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,\nAnd left their usages, their arts and laws,\nTo disappear by a slow gradual death,\nTo dwindle and to perish one by one,\nStarved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul\nOf Liberty, which fifteen hundred years\nSurvived, and, when the European came\nWith skill and power that might not be withstood,\nDid, like a pestilence, maintain its hold\nAnd wasted down by glorious death that race\nOf natural heroes: or I would record\nHow, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,\nUnnamed among the chronicles of kings,\nSuffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,\nHow that one Frenchman, through continued force\nOf meditation on the inhuman deeds\nOf those who conquered first the Indian Isles,\nWent single in his ministry across\nThe Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,\nBut, like a thirsty wind, to roam about\nWithering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought\nHelp at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:\nHow Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name\nOf Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,\nAll over his dear Country; left the deeds\nOf Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,\nTo people the steep rocks and river banks,\nHer natural sanctuaries, with a local soul\nOf independence and stern liberty.\nSometimes it suits me better to invent\nA tale from my own heart, more near akin\nTo my own passions and habitual thoughts;\nSome variegated story, in the main\nLofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts\nBefore the very sun that brightens it,\nMist into air dissolving! Then a wish,\nMy last and favourite aspiration, mounts\nWith yearning toward some philosophic song\nOf Truth that cherishes our daily life;\nWith meditations passionate from deep\nRecesses in man's heart, immortal verse\nThoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;\nBut from this awful burthen I full soon\nTake refuge and beguile myself with trust\nThat mellower years will bring a riper mind\nAnd clearer insight. Thus my days are past\nIn contradiction; with no skill to part\nVague longing, haply bred by want of power,\nFrom paramount impulse not to be withstood,\nA timorous capacity, from prudence,\nFrom circumspection, infinite delay.\nHumility and modest awe, themselves\nBetray me, serving often for a cloak\nTo a more subtle selfishness; that now\nLocks every function up in blank reserve,\nNow dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye\nThat with intrusive restlessness beats off\nSimplicity and self-presented truth.\nAh! better far than this, to stray about\nVoluptuously through fields and rural walks,\nAnd ask no record of the hours, resigned\nTo vacant musing, unreproved neglect\nOf all things, and deliberate holiday.\nFar better never to have heard the name\nOf zeal and just ambition, than to live\nBaffled and plagued by a mind that every hour\nTurns recreant to her task; takes heart again,\nThen feels immediately some hollow thought\nHang like an interdict upon her hopes.\nThis is my lot; for either still I find\nSome imperfection in the chosen theme,\nOr see of absolute accomplishment\nMuch wanting, so much wanting, in myself,\nThat I recoil and droop, and seek repose\nIn listlessness from vain perplexity,\nUnprofitably travelling toward the grave,\nLike a false steward who hath much received\nAnd renders nothing back.\nWas it for this\nThat one, the fairest of all rivers, loved\nTo blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,\nAnd, from his alder shades and rocky falls,\nAnd from his fords and shallows, sent a voice\nThat flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,\nO Derwent! winding among grassy holms\nWhere I was looking on, a babe in arms,\nMake ceaseless music that composed my thoughts\nTo more than infant softness, giving me\nAmid the fretful dwellings of mankind\nA foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm\nThat Nature breathes among the hills and groves.\nWhen he had left the mountains and received\nOn his smooth breast the shadow of those towers\nThat yet survive, a shattered monument\nOf feudal sway, the bright blue river passed\nAlong the margin of our terrace walk;\nA tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.\nOh, many a time have I, a five years' child,\nIn a small mill-race severed from his stream,\nMade one long bathing of a summer's day;\nBasked in the sun, and plunged and basked again\nAlternate, all a summer's day, or scoured\nThe sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves\nOf yellow ragwort; or, when rock and hill,\nThe woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,\nWere bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone\nBeneath the sky, as if I had been born\nOn Indian plains, and from my mother's hut\nHad run abroad in wantonness, to sport\nA naked savage, in the thunder shower.\nFair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up\nFostered alike by beauty and by fear:\nMuch favoured in my birth-place, and no less\nIn that beloved Vale to which erelong\nWe were transplanted;--there were we let loose\nFor sports of wider range. Ere I had told\nTen birth-days, when among the mountain slopes\nFrost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped\nThe last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy\nWith store of springes o'er my shoulder hung\nTo range the open heights where woodcocks run\nAlong the smooth green turf. Through half the night,\nScudding away from snare to snare, I plied\nThat anxious visitation;--moon and stars\nWere shining o'er my head. I was alone,\nAnd seemed to be a trouble to the peace\nThat dwelt among them. Sometimes it befell\nIn these night wanderings, that a strong desire\nO'erpowered my better reason, and the bird\nWhich was the captive of another's toil\nBecame my prey; and when the deed was done\nI heard among the solitary hills\nLow breathings coming after me, and sounds\nOf undistinguishable motion, steps\nAlmost as silent as the turf they trod.\nNor less, when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,\nMoved we as plunderers where the mother-bird\nHad in high places built her lodge; though mean\nOur object and inglorious, yet the end\nWas not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung\nAbove the raven's nest, by knots of grass\nAnd half-inch fissures in the slippery rock\nBut ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)\nSuspended by the blast that blew amain,\nShouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time\nWhile on the perilous ridge I hung alone,\nWith what strange utterance did the loud dry wind\nBlow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky\nOf earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!\nDust as we are, the immortal spirit grows\nLike harmony in music; there is a dark\nInscrutable workmanship that reconciles\nDiscordant elements, makes them cling together\nIn one society. How strange, that all\nThe terrors, pains, and early miseries,\nRegrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused\nWithin my mind, should e'er have borne a part,\nAnd that a needful part, in making up\nThe calm existence that is mine when I\nAm worthy of myself! Praise to the end!\nThanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;\nWhether her fearless visitings, or those\nThat came with soft alarm, like hurtless light\nOpening the peaceful clouds; or she would use\nSeverer interventions, ministry\nMore palpable, as best might suit her aim.\nOne summer evening (led by her) I found\nA little boat tied to a willow tree\nWithin a rocky cave, its usual home.\nStraight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in\nPushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth\nAnd troubled pleasure, nor without the voice\nOf mountain-echoes did my boat move on;\nLeaving behind her still, on either side,\nSmall circles glittering idly in the moon,\nUntil they melted all into one track\nOf sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,\nProud of his skill, to reach a chosen point\nWith an unswerving line, I fixed my view\nUpon the summit of a craggy ridge,\nThe horizon's utmost boundary; far above\nWas nothing but the stars and the grey sky.\nShe was an elfin pinnace; lustily\nI dipped my oars into the silent lake,\nAnd, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat\nWent heaving through the water like a swan;\nWhen, from behind that craggy steep till then\nThe horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,\nAs if with voluntary power instinct,\nUpreared its head. I struck and struck again,\nAnd growing still in stature the grim shape\nTowered up between me and the stars, and still,\nFor so it seemed, with purpose of its own\nAnd measured motion like a living thing,\nStrode after me. With trembling oars I turned,\nAnd through the silent water stole my way\nBack to the covert of the willow tree;\nThere in her mooring-place I left my bark,--\nAnd through the meadows homeward went, in grave\nAnd serious mood; but after I had seen\nThat spectacle, for many days, my brain\nWorked with a dim and undetermined sense\nOf unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts\nThere hung a darkness, call it solitude\nOr blank desertion. No familiar shapes\nRemained, no pleasant images of trees,\nOf sea or sky, no colours of green fields;\nBut huge and mighty forms, that do not live\nLike living men, moved slowly through the mind\nBy day, and were a trouble to my dreams.\nWisdom and Spirit of the universe!\nThou Soul that art the eternity of thought\nThat givest to forms and images a breath\nAnd everlasting motion, not in vain\nBy day or star-light thus from my first dawn\nOf childhood didst thou intertwine for me\nThe passions that build up our human soul;\nNot with the mean and vulgar works of man,\nBut with high objects, with enduring things--\nWith life and nature--purifying thus\nThe elements of feeling and of thought,\nAnd sanctifying, by such discipline,\nBoth pain and fear, until we recognise\nA grandeur in the beatings of the heart.\nNor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me\nWith stinted kindness. In November days,\nWhen vapours rolling down the valley made\nA lonely scene more lonesome, among woods,\nAt noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights,\nWhen, by the margin of the trembling lake,\nBeneath the gloomy hills homeward I went\nIn solitude, such intercourse was mine;\nMine was it in the fields both day and night,\nAnd by the waters, all the summer long.\nAnd in the frosty season, when the sun\nWas set, and visible for many a mile\nThe cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,\nI heeded not their summons: happy time\nIt was indeed for all of us--for me\nIt was a time of rapture! Clear and loud\nThe village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,\nProud and exulting like an untired horse\nThat cares not for his home. All shod with steel,\nWe hissed along the polished ice in games\nConfederate, imitative of the chase\nAnd woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,\nThe pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.\nSo through the darkness and the cold we flew,\nAnd not a voice was idle; with the din\nSmitten, the precipices rang aloud;\nThe leafless trees and every icy crag\nTinkled like iron; while far distant hills\nInto the tumult sent an alien sound\nOf melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars\nEastward were sparkling clear, and in the west\nThe orange sky of evening died away.\nNot seldom from the uproar I retired\nInto a silent bay, or sportively\nGlanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,\nTo cut across the reflex of a star\nThat fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed\nUpon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,\nWhen we had given our bodies to the wind,\nAnd all the shadowy banks on either side\nCame sweeping through the darkness, spinning still\nThe rapid line of motion, then at once\nHave I, reclining back upon my heels,\nStopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs\nWheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled\nWith visible motion her diurnal round!\nBehind me did they stretch in solemn train,\nFeebler and feebler, and I stood and watched\nTill all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.\nYe Presences of Nature in the sky\nAnd on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!\nAnd Souls of lonely places! can I think\nA vulgar hope was yours when ye employed\nSuch ministry, when ye, through many a year\nHaunting me thus among my boyish sports,\nOn caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,\nImpressed, upon all forms, the characters\nOf danger or desire; and thus did make\nThe surface of the universal earth,\nWith triumph and delight, with hope and fear,\nWork like a sea?\nNot uselessly employed,\nMight I pursue this theme through every change\nOf exercise and play, to which the year\nDid summon us in his delightful round.\nWe were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven\nBeheld not vales more beautiful than ours;\nNor saw a band in happiness and joy\nRicher, or worthier of the ground they trod.\nI could record with no reluctant voice\nThe woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers\nWith milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,\nTrue symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong\nAnd unreproved enchantment led us on\nBy rocks and pools shut out from every star,\nAll the green summer, to forlorn cascades\nAmong the windings hid of mountain brooks.\n--Unfading recollections! at this hour\nThe heart is almost mine with which I felt,\nFrom some hill-top on sunny afternoons,\nThe paper kite high among fleecy clouds\nPull at her rein like an impetuous courser;\nOr, from the meadows sent on gusty days,\nBeheld her breast the wind, then suddenly\nDashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.\nYe lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,\nA ministration of your own was yours;\nCan I forget you, being as you were\nSo beautiful among the pleasant fields\nIn which ye stood? or can I here forget\nThe plain and seemly countenance with which\nYe dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye\nDelights and exultations of your own.\nEager and never weary we pursued\nOur home-amusements by the warm peat-fire\nAt evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate\nIn square divisions parcelled out and all\nWith crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,\nWe schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head\nIn strife too humble to be named in verse:\nOr round the naked table, snow-white deal,\nCherry or maple, sate in close array,\nAnd to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on\nA thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,\nNeglected and ungratefully thrown by\nEven for the very service they had wrought,\nBut husbanded through many a long campaign.\nUncouth assemblage was it, where no few\nHad changed their functions: some, plebeian cards\nWhich Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,\nHad dignified, and called to represent\nThe persons of departed potentates.\nOh, with what echoes on the board they fell!\nIronic diamonds,--clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,\nA congregation piteously akin!\nCheap matter offered they to boyish wit,\nThose sooty knaves, precipitated down\nWith scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:\nThe paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,\nQueens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,\nAnd monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained\nBy royal visages. Meanwhile abroad\nIncessant rain was falling, or the frost\nRaged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;\nAnd, interrupting oft that eager game,\nFrom under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice\nThe pent-up air, struggling to free itself,\nGave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud\nProtracted yelling, like the noise of wolves\nHowling in troops along the Bothnic Main.\nNor, sedulous as I have been to trace\nHow Nature by extrinsic passion first\nPeopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,\nAnd made me love them, may I here omit\nHow other pleasures have been mine, and joys\nOf subtler origin; how I have felt,\nNot seldom even in that tempestuous time,\nThose hallowed and pure motions of the sense\nWhich seem, in their simplicity, to own\nAn intellectual charm; that calm delight\nWhich, if I err not, surely must belong\nTo those first-born affinities that fit\nOur new existence to existing things,\nAnd, in our dawn of being, constitute\nThe bond of union between life and joy.\nYes, I remember when the changeful earth,\nAnd twice five summers on my mind had stamped\nThe faces of the moving year, even then\nI held unconscious intercourse with beauty\nOld as creation, drinking in a pure\nOrganic pleasure from the silver wreaths\nOf curling mist, or from the level plain\nOf waters coloured by impending clouds.\nThe sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays\nOf Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell\nHow, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,\nAnd to the shepherd's hut on distant hills\nSent welcome notice of the rising moon,\nHow I have stood, to fancies such as these\nA stranger, linking with the spectacle\nNo conscious memory of a kindred sight,\nAnd bringing with me no peculiar sense\nOf quietness or peace; yet have I stood,\nEven while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league\nOf shining water, gathering as it seemed,\nThrough every hair-breadth in that field of light,\nNew pleasure like a bee among the flowers.\nThus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy\nWhich, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits\nAre prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss\nWhich, like a tempest, works along the blood\nAnd is forgotten; even then I felt\nGleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earth\nAnd common face of Nature spake to me\nRememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,\nBy chance collisions and quaint accidents\n(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed\nOf evil-minded fairies), yet not vain\nNor profitless, if haply they impressed\nCollateral objects and appearances,\nAlbeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep\nUntil maturer seasons called them forth\nTo impregnate and to elevate the mind.\n--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight\nWearied itself out of the memory,\nThe scenes which were a witness of that joy\nRemained in their substantial lineaments\nDepicted on the brain, and to the eye\nWere visible, a daily sight; and thus\nBy the impressive discipline of fear,\nBy pleasure and repeated happiness,\nSo frequently repeated, and by force\nOf obscure feelings representative\nOf things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,\nSo beautiful, so majestic in themselves,\nThough yet the day was distant, did become\nHabitually dear, and all their forms\nAnd changeful colours by invisible links\nWere fastened to the affections.\nI began\nMy story early--not misled, I trust,\nBy an infirmity of love for days\nDisowned by memory--ere the breath of spring\nPlanting my snowdrops among winter snows:\nNor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt\nIn sympathy, that I have lengthened out\nWith fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.\nMeanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch\nInvigorating thoughts from former years;\nMight fix the wavering balance of my mind,\nAnd haply meet reproaches too, whose power\nMay spur me on, in manhood now mature\nTo honourable toil. Yet should these hopes\nProve vain, and thus should neither I be taught\nTo understand myself, nor thou to know\nWith better knowledge how the heart was framed\nOf him thou lovest; need I dread from thee\nHarsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit\nThose recollected hours that have the charm\nOf visionary things, those lovely forms\nAnd sweet sensations that throw back our life,\nAnd almost make remotest infancy\nA visible scene, on which the sun is shining?\nOne end at least hath been attained; my mind\nHath been revived, and if this genial mood\nDesert me not, forthwith shall be brought down\nThrough later years the story of my life.\nThe road lies plain before me;--'tis a theme\nSingle and of determined bounds; and hence\nI choose it rather at this time, than work\nOf ampler or more varied argument,\nWhere I might be discomfited and lost:\nAnd certain hopes are with me, that to thee\nThis labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!",

Finally I reached a crossing in\nthe road.  When I turned to look back the coyote\nwas gone.  At that point, I felt sure I was safe and\ncontinued to walk down the road.  When I\napproached an old shack at the road clearing, I\nnoticed paw prints on the soft ground.  Immediately\nI thought, what animal made those prints, surely\nit wasn’t the coyote that I encountered earlier,\ncertainly not, don’t be silly I thought to myself.\nOnce again I continued to walk forward.  I could\nfeel butterflies in my stomach.  What were those\nprints on the ground.  Trying not to think about it,\nI began to walk faster and faster.  Suddenly I\nheard a noise, it sounded like a scratching noise\nbehind me.  Oh what now, could that be the\ncoyote.  My heart was racing and the sweat\npoured down my face causing my eyes to sting.\nMy vision blurred by my perspiration, I was beside\nmyself and was feeling very  sick to my stomach.\nNever before, have I been so afraid, never so unsure\nof myself.  I wanted to run, but once again\nwondered if the animal that was following me\nmight run and attack me.",

    "human": "Therefore death to us\nIs nothing, nor concerns us in the least,\nSince nature of mind is mortal evermore.\nAnd just as in the ages gone before\nWe felt no touch of ill, when all sides round\nTo battle came the Carthaginian host,\nAnd the times, shaken by tumultuous war,\nUnder the aery coasts of arching heaven\nShuddered and trembled, and all humankind\nDoubted to which the empery should fall\nBy land and sea, thus when we are no more,\nWhen comes that sundering of our body and soul\nThrough which we're fashioned to a single state,\nVerily naught to us, us then no more,\nCan come to pass, naught move our senses then-\nNo, not if earth confounded were with sea,\nAnd sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel\nThe nature of mind and energy of soul,\nAfter their severance from this body of ours,\nYet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds\nAnd wedlock of the soul and body live,\nThrough which we're fashioned to a single state.\nAnd, even if time collected after death\nThe matter of our frames and set it all\nAgain in place as now, and if again\nTo us the light of life were given, O yet\nThat process too would not concern us aught,\nWhen once the self-succession of our sense\nHas been asunder broken. And now and here,\nLittle enough we're busied with the selves\nWe were aforetime, nor, concerning them,\nSuffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze\nBackwards across all yesterdays of time\nThe immeasurable, thinking how manifold\nThe motions of matter are, then couldst thou well\nCredit this too: often these very seeds\n(From which we are to-day) of old were set\nIn the same order as they are to-day-\nYet this we can't to consciousness recall\nThrough the remembering mind. For there hath been\nAn interposed pause of life, and wide\nHave all the motions wandered everywhere\nFrom these our senses. For if woe and ail\nPerchance are toward, then the man to whom\nThe bane can happen must himself be there\nAt that same time. But death precludeth this,\nForbidding life to him on whom might crowd\nSuch irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:\nNothing for us there is to dread in death,\nNo wretchedness for him who is no more,\nThe same estate as if ne'er born before,\nWhen death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.\nHence, where thou seest a man to grieve because\nWhen dead he rots with body laid away,\nOr perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,\nKnow well: he rings not true, and that beneath\nStill works an unseen sting upon his heart,\nHowever he deny that he believes.\nHis shall be aught of feeling after death.\nFor he, I fancy, grants not what he says,\nNor what that presupposes, and he fails\nTo pluck himself with all his roots from life\nAnd cast that self away, quite unawares\nFeigning that some remainder's left behind.\nFor when in life one pictures to oneself\nHis body dead by beasts and vultures torn,\nHe pities his state, dividing not himself\nTherefrom, removing not the self enough\nFrom the body flung away, imagining\nHimself that body, and projecting there\nHis own sense, as he stands beside it: hence\nHe grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks\nThat in true death there is no second self\nAlive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,\nOr stand lamenting that the self lies there\nMangled or burning. For if it an evil is\nDead to be jerked about by jaw and fang\nOf the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not\nBitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,\nOr suffocate in honey, and, reclined\nOn the smooth oblong of an icy slab,\nGrow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth\nDown-crushing from above.\n\"Thee now no more\nThe joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,\nNor little sons run up to snatch their kisses\nAnd touch with silent happiness thy heart.\nThou shalt not speed in undertakings more,\nNor be the warder of thine own no more.\nPoor wretch,\" they say, \"one hostile hour hath ta'en\nWretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons,\"\nBut add not, \"yet no longer unto thee\nRemains a remnant of desire for them\"\nIf this they only well perceived with mind\nAnd followed up with maxims, they would free\nTheir state of man from anguish and from fear.\n\"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,\nSo shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,\nReleased from every harrying pang. But we,\nWe have bewept thee with insatiate woe,\nStanding beside whilst on the awful pyre\nThou wert made ashes; and no day shall take\nFor us the eternal sorrow from the breast.\"\nBut ask the mourner what's the bitterness\nThat man should waste in an eternal grief,\nIf, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?\nFor when the soul and frame together are sunk\nIn slumber, no one then demands his self\nOr being. Well, this sleep may be forever,\nWithout desire of any selfhood more,\nFor all it matters unto us asleep.\nYet not at all do those primordial germs\nRoam round our members, at that time, afar\nFrom their own motions that produce our senses-\nSince, when he's startled from his sleep, a man\nCollects his senses. Death is, then, to us\nMuch less- if there can be a less than that\nWhich is itself a nothing: for there comes\nHard upon death a scattering more great\nOf the throng of matter, and no man wakes up\nOn whom once falls the icy pause of life.\nThis too, O often from the soul men say,\nAlong their couches holding of the cups,\nWith faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:\n\"Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,\nSoon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,\nIt may not be recalled.\"- As if, forsooth,\nIt were their prime of evils in great death\nTo parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,\nOr chafe for any lack.\nOnce more, if Nature\nShould of a sudden send a voice abroad,\nAnd her own self inveigh against us so:\n\"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern\nThat thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?\nWhy this bemoaning and beweeping death?\nFor if thy life aforetime and behind\nTo thee was grateful, and not all thy good\nWas heaped as in sieve to flow away\nAnd perish unavailingly, why not,\nEven like a banqueter, depart the halls,\nLaden with life? why not with mind content\nTake now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?\nBut if whatever thou enjoyed hath been\nLavished and lost, and life is now offence,\nWhy seekest more to add- which in its turn\nWill perish foully and fall out in vain?\nO why not rather make an end of life,\nOf labour? For all I may devise or find\nTo pleasure thee is nothing: all things are\nThe same forever. Though not yet thy body\nWrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts\nOutworn, still things abide the same, even if\nThou goest on to conquer all of time\nWith length of days, yea, if thou never diest\"-\nWhat were our answer, but that Nature here\nUrges just suit and in her words lays down\nTrue cause of action? Yet should one complain,\nRiper in years and elder, and lament,\nPoor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,\nThen would she not, with greater right, on him\nCry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:\n\"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!\nThou wrinklest- after thou hast had the sum\nOf the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever\nWhat's not at hand, contemning present good,\nThat life has slipped away, unperfected\nAnd unavailing unto thee. And now,\nOr ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head\nStands- and before thou canst be going home\nSated and laden with the goodly feast.\nBut now yield all that's alien to thine age,-\nUp, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must.\"\nJustly, I fancy, would she reason thus,\nJustly inveigh and gird: since ever the old\nOutcrowded by the new gives way, and ever\nThe one thing from the others is repaired.\nNor no man is consigned to the abyss\nOf Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,\nThat thus the after-generations grow,-\nThough these, their life completed, follow thee;\nAnd thus like thee are generations all-\nAlready fallen, or some time to fall.\nSo one thing from another rises ever;\nAnd in fee-simple life is given to none,\nBut unto all mere usufruct.\nLook back:\nNothing to us was all fore-passed eld\nOf time the eternal, ere we had a birth.\nAnd Nature holds this like a mirror up\nOf time-to-be when we are dead and gone.\nAnd what is there so horrible appears?\nNow what is there so sad about it all?\nIs't not serener far than any sleep?\nAnd, verily, those tortures said to be\nIn Acheron, the deep, they all are ours\nHere in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed\nWith baseless terror, as the fables tell,\nFears the huge boulder hanging in the air:\nBut, rather, in life an empty dread of gods\nUrges mortality, and each one fears\nSuch fall of fortune as may chance to him.\nNor eat the vultures into Tityus\nProstrate in Acheron, nor can they find,\nForsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught\nTo pry around for in that mighty breast.\nHowever hugely he extend his bulk-\nWho hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,\nBut the whole earth- he shall not able be\nTo bear eternal pain nor furnish food\nFrom his own frame forever. But for us\nA Tityus is he whom vultures rend\nProstrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,\nWhom troubles of any unappeased desires\nAsunder rip. We have before our eyes\nHere in this life also a Sisyphus\nIn him who seeketh of the populace\nThe rods, the axes fell, and evermore\nRetires a beaten and a gloomy man.\nFor to seek after power- an empty name,\nNor given at all- and ever in the search\nTo endure a world of toil, O this it is\nTo shove with shoulder up the hill a stone\nWhich yet comes rolling back from off the top,\nAnd headlong makes for levels of the plain.\nThen to be always feeding an ingrate mind,\nFilling with good things, satisfying never-\nAs do the seasons of the year for us,\nWhen they return and bring their progenies\nAnd varied charms, and we are never filled\nWith the fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis\nTo pour, like those young virgins in the tale,\nWaters into a sieve, unfilled forever.",

What other hope does life hold out\nBut the miraculous, the skilled and patient\nExecution, the teamwork, all the pain and worry every miracle involves?\nVisionaries tossing in their beds, haunted and racked\nBy questions of Messiahship and eschatology,\nAre like the mist rising at nightfall, and come,\nPerhaps to even less. Grave supernaturalists, devoted worshippers\nExperience the ecstasy (such as it is), but not\nOur ecstasy. It was our making. Yet sometimes\nWhen the torrent of that time\nComes pouring back, I wonder at our courage\nAnd our enterprise. It was as though the world\nHad been one darkening, abandoned hall\nWhere rows of unlit candles stood; and we\nNot out of love, so much, or hope, or even worship, but\nOut of the fear of death, came with our lights\nAnd watched the candles, one by one, take fire, flames\nAgainst the long night of our fear. We thought\nThat we could never die. Now I am less convinced.\n--The traveller on the plain makes out the mountains\nAt a distance; then he loses sight. His way\nWinds through the valleys; then, at a sudden turning of a path,\nThe peaks stand nakedly before him: they are something else\nThan what he saw below. I think now of the raft\n(For me, somehow, the summit of the whole experience)\nAnd all the expectations of that day, but also of the cave\nWe stocked with bread, the secret meetings\nIn the hills, the fake assassins hired for the last pursuit,\nThe careful staging of the cures, the bribed officials,\nThe angels' garments, tailored faultlessly,\nThe medicines administered behind the stone,\nThat ultimate cloud, so perfect, and so opportune.\nWho managed all that blood I never knew.\nThe days get longer. It was a long time ago.\nAnd I have come to that point in the turning of the path\nWhere peaks are infinite--horn-shaped and scaly, choked with\nthorns.\nBut even here, I know our work was worth the cost.\nWhat we have brought to pass, no one can take away.\nLife offers up no miracles, unfortunately, and needs assistance.\nNothing will be the same as once it was,\nI tell myself.--It's dark here on the peak, and keeps on getting\ndarker.\nIt seems I am experiencing a kind of ecstasy.\nWas it sunlight on the waves that day? The night comes down.\nAnd now the water seems remote, unreal, and perhaps it is.",

I am dying!\nPoor fellow we kept his body thinking the rest of us would be saved,\nThen, with hunger, Angus McDonald began to cry and madly raved.\nAnd he cried, Oh, God! send us some kind of meat,\nBecause I'm resolved to have something to eat;\nOh! do not let us starve on the briny flood\nOr else I will drink of poor Jim's blood.\nThen he suddenly seized his knife and cut off poor Jim's arm,\nNot thinking in his madness he'd done any harm;\nThen poor Jim's blood he did drink and his flesh did eat,\nDeclaring that the blood tasted like cream, and was a treat.\nThen he asked me to taste it, saying It was good without doubt,\nThen I tasted it, but in disgust I instantly spat it out;\nSaying, if I was to die within an hour on the briny flood,\nI would neither eat the flesh nor drink the blood.\nThen in the afternoon again he turned to me,\nSaying, I'm going to cut Jim's throat for more blood d'ye see;\nThen I begged of him, for God's sake not to cut the throat of poor Jim,\nBut he cried, Ha! ha! to save my own life I consider it no sin.\nI tried to prevent him but he struck me without dismay\nAnd cut poor Jim's throat in defiance of me, or all I could say,\nAlso a piece of flesh from each thigh, and began to eat away,\nBut poor fellow he sickened about noon, and died on the Sunday.\nNow it is all over and I will thank all my life,\nWho has preserved me and my mate, McEachern, in the midst of danger and strife;\nAnd I hope that all landsmen of low and high degree,\nWill think of the hardships of poor mariners while at sea.",

Therefor  while I may feel constant sadness about a certain situation,  I may still be basking; or somewhat happy.

By Fancy's aid\nThe happy husband flies, his arms to throw\nRound his wife's neck; the prize of victory laid\nIn her full lap, he sees such sweet tears flow\nAs if thenceforth nor pain nor trouble she could know.\nVIII\nVain hope! for frand took all that he had earned.\nThe lion roars and gluts his tawny brood\nEven in the desert's heart; but he, returned,\nBears not to those he loves their needful food.\nHis home approaching, but in such a mood\nThat from his sight his children might have run.\nHe met a traveller, robbed him, shed his blood;\nAnd when the miserable work was done\nHe fled, a vagrant since, the murderer's fate to shun.\nIX\nFrom that day forth no place to him could be\nSo lonely, but that thence might come a pang\nBrought from without to inward misery.\nNow, as he plodded on, with sullen clang\nA sound of chains along the desert rang;\nHe looked, and saw upon a gibbet high\nA human body that in irons swang,\nUplifted by the tempest whirling by;\nAnd, hovering, round it often did a raven fly.\nX\nIt was a spectacle which none might view,\nIn spot so savage, but with shuddering pain;\nNor only did for him at once renew\nAll he had feared from man, but roused a train\nOf the mind's phantoms, horrible as vain.\nThe stones, as if to cover him from day,\nRolled at his back along the living plain;\nHe fell, and without sense or motion lay;\nBut, when the trance was gone, feebly pursued his way.\nXI\nAs one whose brain habitual phrensy fires\nOwes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed\nProfounder quiet, when the fit retires,\nEven so the dire phantasma which had crossed\nHis sense, in sudden vacancy quite lost,\nLeft his mind still as a deep evening stream.\nNor, if accosted now, in thought engrossed,\nMoody, or inly troubled, would he seem\nTo traveller who might talk of any casual theme.\nXII\nHurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled,\nGone is the raven timely rest to seek;\nHe seemed the only creature in the wild\nOn whom the elements their rage might wreak;\nSave that the bustard, of those regions bleak\nShy tenant, seeing by the uncertain light\nA man there wandering, gave a mournful shriek,\nAnd half upon the ground, with strange affright,\nForced hard against the wind a thick unwieldy flight.\nXIII\nAll, all was cheerless to the horizon's bound;\nThe weary eye--which, wheresoe'er it strays,\nMarks nothing but the red sun's setting round,\nOr on the earth strange lines, in former days\nLeft by gigantic arms--at length surveys\nWhat seems an antique castle spreading wide;\nHoary and naked are its walls, and raise\nTheir brow sublime: in shelter there to bide\nHe turned, while rain poured down smoking on every side.\nXIV\nPile of Stone-henge! so proud to hint yet keep\nThy secrets, thou that lov'st to stand and hear\nThe Plain resounding to the whirlwind's sweep,\nInmate of lonesome Nature's endless year;\nEven if thou saw'st the giant wicker rear\nFor sacrifice its throngs of living men,\nBefore thy face did ever wretch appear,\nWho in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain\nThan he who, tempest-driven, thy shelter now would gain.\nXV\nWithin that fabric of mysterious form,\nWinds met in conflict, each by turns supreme;\nAnd, from the perilous ground dislodged, through storm\nAnd rain he wildered on, no moon to stream\nFrom gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam,\nNor any friendly sound his footsteps led;\nOnce did the lightning's faint disastrous gleam\nDisclose a naked guide-post's double head,\nSight which tho' lost at once a gleam of pleasure shed.\nXVI\nNo swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm\nTo stay his steps with faintness overcome;\n'Twas dark and void as ocean's watery realm\nRoaring with storms beneath night's starless gloom;\nNo gipsy cowered o'er fire of furze or broom;\nNo labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright,\nNor taper glimmered dim from sick man's room;\nAlong the waste no line of mournful light\nFrom lamp of lonely toll-gate streamed athwart the night.\nXVII\nAt length, though hid in clouds, the moon arose;\nThe downs were visible--and now revealed\nA structure stands, which two bare slopes enclose.\nIt was a spot, where, ancient vows fulfilled,\nKind pious hands did to the Virgin build\nA lonely Spital, the belated swain\nFrom the night terrors of that waste to shield:\nBut there no human being could remain,\nAnd now the walls are named the \"Dead House\" of the plain.\nXVIII\nThough he had little cause to love the abode\nOf man, or covet sight of mortal face,\nYet when faint beams of light that ruin showed,\nHow glad he was at length to find some trace\nOf human shelter in that dreary place.\nTill to his flock the early shepherd goes,\nHere shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace.\nIn a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows\nHe lays his stiffened limbs,--his eyes begin to close;\nXIX\nWhen hearing a deep sigh, that seemed to come\nFrom one who mourned in sleep, he raised his head,\nAnd saw a woman in the naked room\nOutstretched, and turning on a restless bed:\nThe moon a wan dead light around her shed.\nHe waked her--spake in tone that would not fail,\nHe hoped, to calm her mind; but ill he sped,\nFor of that ruin she had heard a tale\nWhich now with freezing thoughts did all her powers assail;\nXX\nHad heard of one who, forced from storms to shroud,\nFelt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat\nRock to incessant neighings shrill and loud,\nWhile his horse pawed the floor with furious heat;\nTill on a stone, that sparkled to his feet,\nStruck, and still struck again, the troubled horse:\nThe man half raised the stone with pain and sweat,\nHalf raised, for well his arm might lose its force\nDisclosing the grim head of a late murdered corse.\nXXI\nSuch tale of this lone mansion she had learned\nAnd, when that shape, with eyes in sleep half drowned,\nBy the moon's sullen lamp she first discerned,\nCold stony horror all her senses bound.\nHer he addressed in words of cheering sound;\nRecovering heart, like answer did she make;\nAnd well it was that, of the corse there found,\nIn converse that ensued she nothing spake;\nShe knew not what dire pangs in him such tale could wake.\nXXII\nBut soon his voice and words of kind intent\nBanished that dismal thought; and now the wind\nIn fainter howlings told its 'rage' was spent:\nMeanwhile discourse ensued of various kind,\nWhich by degrees a confidence of mind\nAnd mutual interest failed not to create.\nAnd, to a natural sympathy resigned,\nIn that forsaken building where they sate\nThe Woman thus retraced her own untoward fate.\nXXIII\n\"By Derwent's side my father dwelt--a man\nOf virtuous life, by pious parents bred;\nAnd I believe that, soon as I began\nTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,\nAnd in his hearing there my prayers I said:\nAnd afterwards, by my good father taught,\nI read, and loved the books in which I read;\nFor books in every neighbouring house I sought,\nAnd nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.\nXXIV\n\"A little croft we owned--a plot of corn,\nA garden stored with peas, and mint, and thyme,\nAnd flowers for posies, oft on Sunday morn\nPlucked while the church bells rang their earliest chime.\nCan I forget our freaks at shearing time!\nMy hen's rich nest through long grass scarce espied;\nThe cowslip-gathering in June's dewy prime;\nThe swans that with white chests upreared in pride\nRushing and racing came to meet me at the water-side.\nXXV\n\"The staff I well remember which upbore\nThe bending body of my active sire;\nHis seat beneath the honied sycamore\nWhere the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;\nWhen market-morning came, the neat attire\nWith which, though bent on haste, myself I decked;\nOur watchful house-dog, that would tease and tire\nThe stranger till its barking-fit I checked;\nThe red-breast, known for years, which at my casement pecked.\nXXVI\n\"The suns of twenty summers danced along,--\nToo little marked how fast they rolled away:\nBut, through severe mischance and cruel wrong,\nMy father's substance fell into decay:\nWe toiled and struggled, hoping for a day\nWhen Fortune might put on a kinder look;\nBut vain were wishes, efforts vain as they;\nHe from his old hereditary nook\nMust part; the summons came;--our final leave we took.\nXXVII\n\"It was indeed a miserable hour\nWhen, from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,\nPeering above the trees, the steeple tower\nThat on his marriage day sweet music made!\nTilt then, he hoped his bones might there be laid\nClose by my mother in their native bowers:\nBidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed;--\nI could not pray:--through tears that fell in showers\nGlimmered our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours!\nXXVIII\n\"There was a Youth whom I had loved so long,\nThat when I loved him not I cannot say:\n'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song\nWe two had sung, like gladsome birds in May;\nWhen we began to tire of childish play,\nWe seemed still more and more to prize each other;\nWe talked of marriage and our marriage day;\nAnd I in truth did love him like a brother,\nFor never could I hope to meet with such another.\nXXIX\n\"Two years were passed since to a distant town\nHe had repaired to ply a gainful trade:\nWhat tears of bitter grief, till then unknown!\nWhat tender vows, our last sad kiss delayed!\nTo him we turned:--we had no other aid:\nLike one revived, upon his neck I wept;\nAnd her whom he had loved in joy, he said,\nHe well could love in grief; his faith he kept;\nAnd in a quiet home once more my father slept.\nXXX\n\"We lived in peace and comfort; and were blest\nWith daily bread, by constant toil supplied.\nThree lovely babes had lain upon my breast;\nAnd often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed,\nAnd knew not why. My happy father died,\nWhen threatened war reduced the children's meal:\nThrice happy! that for him the grave could hide\nThe empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel,\nAnd tears that flowed for ills which patience might not heal.\nXXXI\n\"'Twas a hard change; an evil time was come;\nWe had no hope, and no relief could gain:\nBut soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum\nBeat round to clear the streets of want and pain.\nMy husband's arms now only served to strain\nMe and his children hungering in his view;\nIn such dismay my prayers and tears were vain:\nTo join those miserable men he flew,\nAnd now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew.\nXXXII\n\"There were we long neglected, and we bore\nMuch sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed;\nGreen fields before us, and our native shore,\nWe breathed a pestilential air, that made\nRavage for which no knell was heard. We prayed\nFor our departure; wished and wished--nor knew,\n'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed,\nThat happier days we never more must view.\nThe parting signal streamed--at last the land withdrew.\nXXXIII\n\"But the calm summer season now was past.\nOn as we drove, the equinoctial deep\nRan mountains high before the howling blast,\nAnd many perished in the whirlwind's sweep.\nWe gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep,\nUntaught that soon such anguish must ensue,\nOur hopes such harvest of affliction reap,\nThat we the mercy of the waves should rue:\nWe reached the western world, a poor devoted crew.\nXXXIV\n\"The pains and plagues that on our heads came down,\nDisease and famine, agony and fear,\nIn wood or wilderness, in camp or town,\nIt would unman the firmest heart to hear.\nAll perished--all in one remorseless year,\nHusband and children! one by one, by sword\nAnd ravenous plague, all perished: every tear\nDried up, despairing, desolate, on board\nA British ship I waked, as from a trance restored.\"\nXXXV\nHere paused she of all present thought forlorn,\nNor voice nor sound, that moment's pain expressed,\nYet Nature, with excess of grief o'erborne,\nFrom her full eyes their watery load released.\nHe too was mute; and, ere her weeping ceased,\nHe rose, and to the ruin's portal went,\nAnd saw the dawn opening the silvery east\nWith rays of promise, north and southward sent;\nAnd soon with crimson fire kindled the firmament.\nXXXVI\n\"O come,\" he cried, \"come, after weary night\nOf such rough storm, this happy change to view.\"\nSo forth she came, and eastward looked; the sight\nOver her brow like dawn of gladness threw;\nUpon her cheek, to which its youthful hue\nSeemed to return, dried the last lingering tear,\nAnd from her grateful heart a fresh one drew:\nThe whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer\nTempered fit words of hope; and the lark warbled near.\nXXXVII\nThey looked and saw a lengthening road, and wain\nThat rang down a bare slope not far remote:\nThe barrows glistered bright with drops of rain,\nWhistled the waggoner with merry note,\nThe cock far off sounded his clarion throat;\nBut town, or farm, or hamlet, none they viewed,\nOnly were told there stood a lonely cot\nA long mile thence. While thither they pursued\nTheir way, the Woman thus her mournful tale renewed.\nXXXVIII\n\"Peaceful as this immeasurable plain\nIs now, by beams of dawning light imprest,\nIn the calm sunshine slept the glittering main;\nThe very ocean hath its hour of rest.\nI too forgot the heavings of my breast.\nHow quiet 'round me ship and ocean were!\nAs quiet all within me. I was blest,\nAnd looked, and fed upon the silent air\nUntil it seemed to bring a joy to my despair.\nXXXIX\n\"Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps,\nAnd groans that rage of racking famine spoke;\nThe unburied dead that lay in festering heaps,\nThe breathing pestilence that rose like smoke,\nThe shriek that from the distant battle broke,\nThe mine's dire earthquake, and the pallid host\nDriven by the bomb's incessant thunderstroke\nTo loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish tossed,\nHope died, and fear itself in agony was lost!\nXL\n\"Some mighty gulf of separation past,\nI seemed transported to another world;\nA thought resigned with pain, when from the mast\nThe impatient mariner the sail unfurled,\nAnd, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled\nThe silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home\nAnd from all hope I was for ever hurled.\nFor me--farthest from earthly port to roam\nWas best, could I but shun the spot where man might come.\nXLI\n\"And oft I thought (my fancy was so strong)\nThat I, at last, a resting-place had found;\n'Here will I dwell,' said I, 'my whole life long,\nRoaming the illimitable waters round;\nHere will I live, of all but heaven disowned,\nAnd end my days upon the peaceful flood.'--\nTo break my dream the vessel reached its bound;\nAnd homeless near a thousand homes I stood,\nAnd near a thousand tables pined and wanted food.\nXLII\n\"No help I sought; in sorrow turned adrift,\nWas hopeless, as if cast on some bare rock;\nNor morsel to my mouth that day did lift,\nNor raised my hand at any door to knock.\nI lay where, with his drowsy mates, the cock\nFrom the cross-timber of an out-house hung:\nDismally tolled, that night, the city clock!\nAt morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung,\nNor to the beggar's language could I fit my tongue.\nXLIII\n\"So passed a second day; and, when the third\nWas come, I tried in vain the crowd's resort.\n--In deep despair, by frightful wishes stirred,\nNear the sea-side I reached a ruined fort;\nThere, pains which nature could no more support,\nWith blindness linked, did on my vitals fall;\nAnd, after many interruptions short\nOf hideous sense, I sank, nor step could crawl:\nUnsought for was the help that did my life recall.\nXLIV\n\"Borne to a hospital, I lay with brain\nDrowsy and weak, and shattered memory;\nI heard my neighbours in their beds complain\nOf many things which never troubled me--\nOf feet still bustling round with busy glee,\nOf looks where common kindness had no part,\nOf service done with cold formality,\nFretting the fever round the languid heart,\nAnd groans which, as they said, might make a dead man start.\nXLV\n\"These things just served to stir the slumbering sense,\nNor pain nor pity in my bosom raised.\nWith strength did memory return; and, thence\nDismissed, again on open day I gazed,\nAt houses, men, and common light, amazed.\nThe lanes I sought, and, as the sun retired,\nCame where beneath the trees a faggot blazed,\nThe travellers saw me weep, my fate inquired,\nAnd gave me food--and rest, more welcome, more desired.\nXLVI\n\"Rough potters seemed they, trading soberly\nWith panniered asses driven from door to door;\nBut life of happier sort set forth to me,\nAnd other joys my fancy to allure--\nThe bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor\nIn barn uplighted; and companions boon,\nWell met from far with revelry secure\nAmong the forest glades, while jocund June\nRolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon.\nXLVII\n\"But ill they suited me--those journeys dark\nO'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch!\nTo charm the surly house-dog's faithful bark,\nOr hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch.\nThe gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match,\nThe black disguise, the warning whistle shrill,\nAnd ear still busy on its nightly watch,\nWere not for me, brought up in nothing ill:\nBesides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still.\nXLVIII\n\"What could I do, unaided and unblest?\nMy father! gone was every friend of thine:\nAnd kindred of dead husband are at best\nSmall help; and, after marriage such as mine,\nWith little kindness would to me incline.\nNor was I then for toil or service fit;\nMy deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine;\nIn open air forgetful would I sit\nWhole hours, with idle arms in moping sorrow knit.\nXLIX\n\"The roads I paced, I loitered through the fields;\nContentedly, yet sometimes self-accused.\nTrusted my life to what chance bounty yields,\nNow coldly given, now utterly refused.\nThe ground I for my bed have often used:\nBut what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth,\nIs that I have my inner self abused,\nForegone the home delight of constant truth,\nAnd clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth.\nL\n\"Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed,\nThrough tears have seen him towards that world descend\nWhere my poor heart lost all its fortitude:\nThree years a wanderer now my course I bend--\nOh! tell me whither--for no earthly friend\nHave I.\"--She ceased, and weeping turned away;\nAs if because her tale was at an end,\nShe wept; because she had no more to say\nOf that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay.\nLI\nTrue sympathy the Sailor's looks expressed,\nHis looks--for pondering he was mute the while.\nOf social Order's care for wretchedness,\nOf Time's sure help to calm and reconcile,\nJoy's second spring and Hope's long-treasured smile,\n'Twas not for 'him' to speak--a man so tried,\nYet, to relieve her heart, in friendly style\nProverbial words of comfort he applied,\nAnd not in vain, while they went pacing side by side.\nLII\nEre long, from heaps of turf, before their sight,\nTogether smoking in the sun's slant beam,\nRise various wreaths that into one unite\nWhich high and higher mounts with silver gleam:\nFair spectacle,---but instantly a scream\nThence bursting shrill did all remark prevent;\nThey paused, and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme,\nAnd female cries. Their course they thither bent,\nAnd met a man who foamed with anger vehement,\nLIII\nA woman stood with quivering lips and pale,\nAnd, pointing to a little child that lay\nStretched on the ground, began a piteous tale;\nHow in a simple freak of thoughtless play\nHe had provoked his father, who straightway,\nAs if each blow were deadlier than the last,\nStruck the poor innocent. Pallid with dismay\nThe Soldier's Widow heard and stood aghast;\nAnd stern looks on the man her grey-haired Comrade cast.\nLIV\nHis voice with indignation rising high\nSuch further deed in manhood's name forbade;\nThe peasant, wild in passion, made reply\nWith bitter insult and revilings sad;\nAsked him in scorn what business there he had;\nWhat kind of plunder he was hunting now;\nThe gallows would one day of him be glad;--\nThough inward anguish damped the Sailor's brow,\nYet calm he seemed as thoughts so poignant would allow.\nLV\nSoftly he stroked the child, who lay outstretched\nWith face to earth; and, as the boy turned round\nHis battered head, a groan the Sailor fetched\nAs if he saw--there and upon that ground--\nStrange repetition of the deadly wound\nHe had himself inflicted. Through his brain\nAt once the griding iron passage found;\nDeluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain,\nNor could his sunken eyes the starting tear restrain.\nLVI\nWithin himself he said--What hearts have we!\nThe blessing this a father gives his child!\nYet happy thou, poor boy! compared with me,\nSuffering not doing ill--fate far more mild.\nThe stranger's looks and tears of wrath beguiled\nThe father, and relenting thoughts awoke;\nHe kissed his son--so all was reconciled.\nThen, with a voice which inward trouble broke\nEre to his lips it came, the Sailor them bespoke.\nLVII\n\"Bad is the world, and hard is the world's law\nEven for the man who wears the warmest fleece;\nMuch need have ye that time more closely draw\nThe bond of nature, all unkindness cease,\nAnd that among so few there still be peace:\nElse can ye hope but with such numerous foes\nYour pains shall ever with your years increase?\"--\nWhile from his heart the appropriate lesson flows,\nA correspondent calm stole gently o'er his woes.\nLVIII\nForthwith the pair passed on; and down they look\nInto a narrow valley's pleasant scene\nWhere wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook,\nThat babbled on through groves and meadows green;\nA low-roofed house peeped out the trees between;\nThe dripping groves resound with cheerful lays,\nAnd melancholy lowings intervene\nOf scattered herds, that in the meadow graze,\nSome amid lingering shade, some touched by the sun's rays.\nLIX\nThey saw and heard, and, winding with the road,\nDown a thick wood, they dropt into the vale;\nComfort, by prouder mansions unbestowed,\nTheir wearied frames, she hoped, would soon regale.\nErelong they reached that cottage in the dale:\nIt was a rustic inn;--the board was spread,\nThe milk-maid followed with her brimming pail,\nAnd lustily the master carved the bread,\nKindly the housewife pressed, and they in comfort fed.\nLX\nTheir breakfast done, the pair, though loth, must part;\nWanderers whose course no longer now agrees.\nShe rose and bade farewell! and, while her heart\nStruggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease,\nShe left him there; for, clustering round his knees,\nWith his oak-staff the cottage children played;\nAnd soon she reached a spot o'erhung with trees\nAnd banks of ragged earth; beneath the shade\nAcross the pebbly road a little runnel strayed.\nLXI\nA cart and horse beside the rivulet stood;\nChequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone.\nShe saw the carman bend to scoop the flood\nAs the wain fronted her,--wherein lay one,\nA pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone.\nThe carman wet her lips as well behoved;\nBed under her lean body there was none,\nThough even to die near one she most had loved\nShe could not of herself those wasted limbs have moved.\nLXII\nThe Soldier's Widow learned with honest pain\nAnd homefelt force of sympathy sincere,\nWhy thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain\nThe jolting road and morning air severe.\nThe wain pursued its way; and following near\nIn pure compassion she her steps retraced\nFar as the cottage. \"A sad sight is here,\"\nShe cried aloud; and forth ran out in haste\nThe friends whom she had left but a few minutes past.\nLXIII\nWhile to the door with eager speed they ran,\nFrom her bare straw the Woman half upraised\nHer bony visage--gaunt and deadly wan;\nNo pity asking, on the group she gazed\nWith a dim eye, distracted and amazed;\nThen sank upon her straw with feeble moan.\nFervently cried the housewife--\"God be praised,\nI have a house that I can call my own;\nNor shall she perish there, untended and alone!\"\nLXIV\nSo in they bear her to the chimney seat,\nAnd busily, though yet with fear, untie\nHer garments, and, to warm her icy feet\nAnd chafe her temples, careful hands apply.\nNature reviving, with a deep-drawn sigh\nShe strove, and not in vain, her head to rear;\nThen said--\"I thank you all; if I must die,\nThe God in heaven my prayers for you will hear;\nTill now I did not think my end had been so near.\nLXV\n\"Barred every comfort labour could procure,\nSuffering what no endurance could assuage,\nI was compelled to seek my father's door,\nThough loth to be a burthen on his age.\nBut sickness stopped me in an early stage\nOf my sad journey; and within the wain\nThey placed me--there to end life's pilgrimage,\nUnless beneath your roof I may remain;\nFor I shall never see my father's door again.\nLXVI\n\"My life, Heaven knows, hath long been burthensome;\nBut, if I have not meekly suffered, meek\nMay my end be! Soon will this voice be dumb:\nShould child of mine e'er wander hither, speak\nOf me, say that the worm is on my cheek.--\nTorn from our hut, that stood beside the sea\nNear Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek,\nMy husband served in sad captivity\nOn shipboard, bound till peace or death should set him free.\nLXVII\n\"A sailor's wife I knew a widow's cares,\nYet two sweet little ones partook my bed;\nHope cheered my dreams, and to my daily prayers\nOur heavenly Father granted each day's bread;\nTill one was found by stroke of violence dead,\nWhose body near our cottage chanced to lie;\nA dire suspicion drove us from our shed;\nIn vain to find a friendly face we try,\nNor could we live together those poor boys and I;\nLXVIII\n\"For evil tongues made oath how on that day\nMy husband lurked about the neighbourhood;\nNow he had fled, and whither none could say,\nAnd 'he' had done the deed in the dark wood--\nNear his own home!--but he was mild and good;\nNever on earth was gentler creature seen;\nHe'd not have robbed the raven of its food.\nMy husband's lovingkindness stood between\nMe and all worldly harms and wrongs however keen.\"\nLXIX\nAlas! the thing she told with labouring breath\nThe Sailor knew too well. That wickedness\nHis hand had wrought; and when, in the hour of death,\nHe saw his Wife's lips move his name to bless\nWith her last words, unable to suppress\nHis anguish, with his heart he ceased to strive;\nAnd, weeping loud in this extreme distress,\nHe cried--\"Do pity me! That thou shouldst live\nI neither ask nor wish--forgive me, but forgive!\"\nLXX\nTo tell the change that Voice within her wrought\nNature by sign or sound made no essay;\nA sudden joy surprised expiring thought,\nAnd every mortal pang dissolved away.\nBorne gently to a bed, in death she lay;\nYet still while over her the husband bent,\nA look was in her face which seemed to say,\n\"Be blest; by sight of thee from heaven was sent\nPeace to my parting soul, the fulness of content.\"\nLXXI\n'She' slept in peace,--his pulses throbbed and stopped,\nBreathless he gazed upon her face,--then took\nHer hand in his, and raised it, but both dropped,\nWhen on his own he cast a rueful look.\nHis ears were never silent; sleep forsook\nHis burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead;\nAll night from time to time under him shook\nThe floor as he lay shuddering on his bed;\nAnd oft he groaned aloud, \"O God, that I were dead!\"\nLXXII\nThe Soldier's Widow lingered in the cot,\nAnd, when he rose, he thanked her pious care\nThrough which his Wife, to that kind shelter brought,\nDied in his arms; and with those thanks a prayer\nHe breathed for her, and for that merciful pair.\nThe corse interred, not one hour heremained\nBeneath their roof, but to the open air\nA burthen, now with fortitude sustained,\nHe bore within a breast where dreadful quiet reigned.\nLXXIII\nConfirmed of purpose, fearlessly prepared\nFor act and suffering, to the city straight\nHe journeyed, and forthwith his crime declared:\n\"And from your doom,\" he added, \"now I wait,\nNor let it linger long, the murderer's fate.\"\nNot ineffectual was that piteous claim:\n\"O welcome sentence which will end though late,\"\nHe said, \"the pangs that to my conscience came\nOut of that deed.
