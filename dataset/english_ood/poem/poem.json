I rise into adult air\nlike a hollyhock, I’m so proud to be loved\nlike this. The air is tight to my nervous body.\nI use new clothes and shoes the way the corn-studded\nsoil around here uses nitrogen, giddily.\nOhio, Ohio, Ohio. Often I sing\nto myself all day like a fieldful of August\ninsects, just things I whisper, really,\na trance in sneakers. I’m learning\nto read from my mother and soon I’ll go to school,\nI hate it when anyone dies or leaves and the air\ngoes slack around my body and I have to hug myself,\na cloud, an imaginary friend, the stream in the road-\nside park. I love to be called for dinner.\nSpot goes out and I go in and the lights\nin the kitchen go on and the dark,\nwhich also has a body like a cloud’s,\nleans lightly against the house. Tomorrow\nI’ll find the sweat stains it left, little grey smudges.\nHere’s a sky no higher than a street lamp,\nand a stack of morning papers cinched by wire.\nIt’s 4:00 A.M. A stout dog, vaguely beagle,\nminces over the dry, fresh-fallen snow;\nand here’s our sleep-sodden paperboy\nwith his pliers, his bike, his matronly dog,\nhis unclouding face set for paper route\nlike an alarm clock. Here’s a memory\nin the making, for this could be the morning\nhe doesn’t come home and his parents\ntwo hours later drive his route until\nthey find him asleep, propped against a street lamp,\nhis papers all delivered and his dirty paper-\nsatchel slack, like an emptied lung,\nand he blur-faced and iconic in the morning\nair rinsing itself a paler and paler blue\nthrough which a last few dandruff-flecks\nof snow meander casually down.\nThe dog squeaks in out of the dark,\nsnuffling me too me too. And here he goes\nhome to memory, and to hot chocolate\non which no crinkled skin forms like infant ice,\nand to the long and ordinary day,\nschool, two triumphs and one severe\nhumiliation on the playground, the past\nalready growing its scabs, the busride home,\ndinner, and evening leading to sleep\nlike the slide that will spill him out, come June,\ninto the eye-reddening chlorine waters\nof the municipal pool. Here he goes to bed.\nKiss. Kiss. Teeth. Prayers. Dark. Dark.\nHere the dog lies down by his bed,\nand sighs and farts. Will he always be\nthis skinny, chicken-bones?\nHe’ll remember like a prayer\nhow his mother made breakfast for him\nevery morning before he trudged out\nto snip the papers free. Just as\nhis mother will remember she felt\nguilty never to wake up with him\nto give him breakfast. It was Cream\nof Wheat they always or never had together.\nIt turns out you are the story of your childhood\nand you’re under constant revision,\nlike a lonely folktale whose invisible folks\nare all the selves you’ve been, lifelong,\nshadows in fog, grey glimmers at dusk.\nAnd each of these selves had a childhood\nit traded for love and grudged to give away,\nnow lost irretrievably, in storage\nlike a set of dishes from which no food,\nno Cream of Wheat, no rabbit in mustard\nsauce, nor even a single raspberry,\ncan be eaten until the afterlife,\nwhich is only childhood in its last\ndisguise, all radiance or all humiliation,\nand so it is forfeit a final time.\nIn fact it was awful, you think, or why\nshould the piecework of grief be endless?\nOnly because death is, and likewise loss,\nwhich is not awful, but only breathtaking.\nThere’s no truth about your childhood,\nthough there’s a story, yours to tend,\nlike a fire or garden. Make it a good one,\nsince you’ll have to live it out, and all\nits revisions, so long as you all shall live,\nfor they shall be gathered to your deathbed,\nand they’ll have known to what you and they\nwould come, and this one time they’ll weep for you.\nThe map in the shopping center has an X\nsigned “you are here.” A dream is like that.\nIn a dream you are never eighty, though\nyou may risk death by other means:\nyou’re on a ledge and memory calls you\nto jump, but a deft cop talks you in\nto a small, bright room, and snickers.\nAnd in a dream, you’re everyone somewhat,\nbut not wholly. I think I know how that\nworks: for twenty-one years I had a father\nand then I became a father, replacing him\nbut not really. Soon my sons will be fathers.\nSurely, that’s what middle-aged means,\nbeing father and son to sons and father.\nThat a male has only one mother is another\nstory, told wherever men weep wholly.\nThough nobody’s replaced. In one dream\nI’m leading a rope of children to safety,\nthrough a snowy farm. The farmer comes out\nand I have to throw snowballs well to him\nso we may pass. Even dreaming, I know\nhe’s my father, at ease in his catcher’s\nsquat, and that the dream has revived\nto us both an old unspoken fantasy:\nwe’re a battery. I’m young, I’m brash,\nI don’t know how to pitch but I can\nthrow a lamb chop past a wolf. And he\ncan handle pitchers and control a game.\nI look to him for a sign. I’d nod\nfor anything. The damn thing is hard to grip\nwithout seams, and I don’t rely only\non my live, young arm, but throw by all\nthe body I can get behind it, and it fluffs\ntoward him no faster than the snow\nin the dream drifts down. Nothing\ntakes forever, but I know what the phrase\nmeans. The children grow more cold\nand hungry and cruel to each other\nthe longer the ball’s in the air, and it begins\nto melt. By the time it gets to him we’ll be\nour waking ages, and each of us is himself\nalone, and we all join hands and go.\nToward dawn, rain explodes on the tin roof\nlike popcorn. The pale light is streaked by grey\nand that green you see just under the surface\nof water, a shimmer more than a color.\nTime to dive back into sleep, as if into\nhappiness, that neglected discipline ....\nIn those sixth-grade book reports\nyou had to say if the book was optimistic\nor not, and everyone looked at you\nthe same way: how would he turn out?\nHe rolls in his sleep like an otter.\nUncle Ed has a neck so fat it’s funny,\nand on the way to work he pries the cap\noff a Pepsi. Damn rain didn’t cool one weary\nthing for long; it’s gonna be a cooker.\nThe boy sleeps with a thin chain of sweat\non his upper lip, as if waking itself,\nbecoming explicit, were hard work.\nWho knows if he’s happy or not?\nA child is all the tools a child has,\ngrowing up, who makes what he can.",

        "text": "OH there is blessing in this gentle breeze,\nA visitant that while it fans my cheek\nDoth seem half-conscious of the joy it brings\nFrom the green fields, and from yon azure sky.\nWhate'er its mission, the soft breeze can come\nTo none more grateful than to me; escaped\nFrom the vast city, where I long had pined\nA discontented sojourner: now free,\nFree as a bird to settle where I will.\nWhat dwelling shall receive me? in what vale\nShall be my harbour? underneath what grove\nShall I take up my home? and what clear stream\nShall with its murmur lull me into rest?\nThe earth is all before me. With a heart\nJoyous, nor scared at its own liberty,\nI look about; and should the chosen guide\nBe nothing better than a wandering cloud,\nI cannot miss my way. I breathe again!\nTrances of thought and mountings of the mind\nCome fast upon me: it is shaken off,\nThat burthen of my own unnatural self,\nThe heavy weight of many a weary day\nNot mine, and such as were not made for me.\nLong months of peace (if such bold word accord\nWith any promises of human life),\nLong months of ease and undisturbed delight\nAre mine in prospect; whither shall I turn,\nBy road or pathway, or through trackless field,\nUp hill or down, or shall some floating thing\nUpon the river point me out my course?\nDear Liberty! Yet what would it avail\nBut for a gift that consecrates the joy?\nFor I, methought, while the sweet breath of heaven\nWas blowing on my body, felt within\nA correspondent breeze, that gently moved\nWith quickening virtue, but is now become\nA tempest, a redundant energy,\nVexing its own creation. Thanks to both,\nAnd their congenial powers, that, while they join\nIn breaking up a long-continued frost,\nBring with them vernal promises, the hope\nOf active days urged on by flying hours,--\nDays of sweet leisure, taxed with patient thought\nAbstruse, nor wanting punctual service high,\nMatins and vespers of harmonious verse!\nThus far, O Friend! did I, not used to make\nA present joy the matter of a song,\nPour forth that day my soul in measured strains\nThat would not be forgotten, and are here\nRecorded: to the open fields I told\nA prophecy: poetic numbers came\nSpontaneously to clothe in priestly robe\nA renovated spirit singled out,\nSuch hope was mine, for holy services.\nMy own voice cheered me, and, far more, the mind's\nInternal echo of the imperfect sound;\nTo both I listened, drawing from them both\nA cheerful confidence in things to come.\nContent and not unwilling now to give\nA respite to this passion, I paced on\nWith brisk and eager steps; and came, at length,\nTo a green shady place, where down I sate\nBeneath a tree, slackening my thoughts by choice\nAnd settling into gentler happiness.\n'Twas autumn, and a clear and placid day,\nWith warmth, as much as needed, from a sun\nTwo hours declined towards the west; a day\nWith silver clouds, and sunshine on the grass,\nAnd in the sheltered and the sheltering grove\nA perfect stillness. Many were the thoughts\nEncouraged and dismissed, till choice was made\nOf a known Vale, whither my feet should turn,\nNor rest till they had reached the very door\nOf the one cottage which methought I saw.\nNo picture of mere memory ever looked\nSo fair; and while upon the fancied scene\nI gazed with growing love, a higher power\nThan Fancy gave assurance of some work\nOf glory there forthwith to be begun,\nPerhaps too there performed. Thus long I mused,\nNor e'er lost sight of what I mused upon,\nSave when, amid the stately grove of oaks,\nNow here, now there, an acorn, from its cup\nDislodged, through sere leaves rustled, or at once\nTo the bare earth dropped with a startling sound.\nFrom that soft couch I rose not, till the sun\nHad almost touched the horizon; casting then\nA backward glance upon the curling cloud\nOf city smoke, by distance ruralised;\nKeen as a Truant or a Fugitive,\nBut as a Pilgrim resolute, I took,\nEven with the chance equipment of that hour,\nThe road that pointed toward the chosen Vale.\nIt was a splendid evening, and my soul\nOnce more made trial of her strength, nor lacked\nAeolian visitations; but the harp\nWas soon defrauded, and the banded host\nOf harmony dispersed in straggling sounds,\nAnd lastly utter silence! 'Be it so;\nWhy think of anything but present good?'\nSo, like a home-bound labourer, I pursued\nMy way beneath the mellowing sun, that shed\nMild influence; nor left in me one wish\nAgain to bend the Sabbath of that time\nTo a servile yoke. What need of many words?\nA pleasant loitering journey, through three days\nContinued, brought me to my hermitage.\nI spare to tell of what ensued, the life\nIn common things--the endless store of things,\nRare, or at least so seeming, every day\nFound all about me in one neighbourhood--\nThe self-congratulation, and, from morn\nTo night, unbroken cheerfulness serene.\nBut speedily an earnest longing rose\nTo brace myself to some determined aim,\nReading or thinking; either to lay up\nNew stores, or rescue from decay the old\nBy timely interference: and therewith\nCame hopes still higher, that with outward life\nI might endue some airy phantasies\nThat had been floating loose about for years,\nAnd to such beings temperately deal forth\nThe many feelings that oppressed my heart.\nThat hope hath been discouraged; welcome light\nDawns from the east, but dawns to disappear\nAnd mock me with a sky that ripens not\nInto a steady morning: if my mind,\nRemembering the bold promise of the past,\nWould gladly grapple with some noble theme,\nVain is her wish; where'er she turns she finds\nImpediments from day to day renewed.\nAnd now it would content me to yield up\nThose lofty hopes awhile, for present gifts\nOf humbler industry. But, oh, dear Friend!\nThe Poet, gentle creature as he is,\nHath, like the Lover, his unruly times;\nHis fits when he is neither sick nor well,\nThough no distress be near him but his own\nUnmanageable thoughts: his mind, best pleased\nWhile she as duteous as the mother dove\nSits brooding, lives not always to that end,\nBut like the innocent bird, hath goadings on\nThat drive her as in trouble through the groves;\nWith me is now such passion, to be blamed\nNo otherwise than as it lasts too long.\nWhen, as becomes a man who would prepare\nFor such an arduous work, I through myself\nMake rigorous inquisition, the report\nIs often cheering; for I neither seem\nTo lack that first great gift, the vital soul,\nNor general Truths, which are themselves a sort\nOf Elements and Agents, Under-powers,\nSubordinate helpers of the living mind:\nNor am I naked of external things,\nForms, images, nor numerous other aids\nOf less regard, though won perhaps with toil\nAnd needful to build up a Poet's praise.\nTime, place, and manners do I seek, and these\nAre found in plenteous store, but nowhere such\nAs may be singled out with steady choice;\nNo little band of yet remembered names\nWhom I, in perfect confidence, might hope\nTo summon back from lonesome banishment,\nAnd make them dwellers in the hearts of men\nNow living, or to live in future years.\nSometimes the ambitious Power of choice, mistaking\nProud spring-tide swellings for a regular sea,\nWill settle on some British theme, some old\nRomantic tale by Milton left unsung;\nMore often turning to some gentle place\nWithin the groves of Chivalry, I pipe\nTo shepherd swains, or seated harp in hand,\nAmid reposing knights by a river side\nOr fountain, listen to the grave reports\nOf dire enchantments faced and overcome\nBy the strong mind, and tales of warlike feats,\nWhere spear encountered spear, and sword with sword\nFought, as if conscious of the blazonry\nThat the shield bore, so glorious was the strife;\nWhence inspiration for a song that winds\nThrough ever-changing scenes of votive quest\nWrongs to redress, harmonious tribute paid\nTo patient courage and unblemished truth,\nTo firm devotion, zeal unquenchable,\nAnd Christian meekness hallowing faithful loves.\nSometimes, more sternly moved, I would relate\nHow vanquished Mithridates northward passed,\nAnd, hidden in the cloud of years, became\nOdin, the Father of a race by whom\nPerished the Roman Empire: how the friends\nAnd followers of Sertorius, out of Spain\nFlying, found shelter in the Fortunate Isles,\nAnd left their usages, their arts and laws,\nTo disappear by a slow gradual death,\nTo dwindle and to perish one by one,\nStarved in those narrow bounds: but not the soul\nOf Liberty, which fifteen hundred years\nSurvived, and, when the European came\nWith skill and power that might not be withstood,\nDid, like a pestilence, maintain its hold\nAnd wasted down by glorious death that race\nOf natural heroes: or I would record\nHow, in tyrannic times, some high-souled man,\nUnnamed among the chronicles of kings,\nSuffered in silence for Truth's sake: or tell,\nHow that one Frenchman, through continued force\nOf meditation on the inhuman deeds\nOf those who conquered first the Indian Isles,\nWent single in his ministry across\nThe Ocean; not to comfort the oppressed,\nBut, like a thirsty wind, to roam about\nWithering the Oppressor: how Gustavus sought\nHelp at his need in Dalecarlia's mines:\nHow Wallace fought for Scotland; left the name\nOf Wallace to be found, like a wild flower,\nAll over his dear Country; left the deeds\nOf Wallace, like a family of Ghosts,\nTo people the steep rocks and river banks,\nHer natural sanctuaries, with a local soul\nOf independence and stern liberty.\nSometimes it suits me better to invent\nA tale from my own heart, more near akin\nTo my own passions and habitual thoughts;\nSome variegated story, in the main\nLofty, but the unsubstantial structure melts\nBefore the very sun that brightens it,\nMist into air dissolving! Then a wish,\nMy last and favourite aspiration, mounts\nWith yearning toward some philosophic song\nOf Truth that cherishes our daily life;\nWith meditations passionate from deep\nRecesses in man's heart, immortal verse\nThoughtfully fitted to the Orphean lyre;\nBut from this awful burthen I full soon\nTake refuge and beguile myself with trust\nThat mellower years will bring a riper mind\nAnd clearer insight. Thus my days are past\nIn contradiction; with no skill to part\nVague longing, haply bred by want of power,\nFrom paramount impulse not to be withstood,\nA timorous capacity, from prudence,\nFrom circumspection, infinite delay.\nHumility and modest awe, themselves\nBetray me, serving often for a cloak\nTo a more subtle selfishness; that now\nLocks every function up in blank reserve,\nNow dupes me, trusting to an anxious eye\nThat with intrusive restlessness beats off\nSimplicity and self-presented truth.\nAh! better far than this, to stray about\nVoluptuously through fields and rural walks,\nAnd ask no record of the hours, resigned\nTo vacant musing, unreproved neglect\nOf all things, and deliberate holiday.\nFar better never to have heard the name\nOf zeal and just ambition, than to live\nBaffled and plagued by a mind that every hour\nTurns recreant to her task; takes heart again,\nThen feels immediately some hollow thought\nHang like an interdict upon her hopes.\nThis is my lot; for either still I find\nSome imperfection in the chosen theme,\nOr see of absolute accomplishment\nMuch wanting, so much wanting, in myself,\nThat I recoil and droop, and seek repose\nIn listlessness from vain perplexity,\nUnprofitably travelling toward the grave,\nLike a false steward who hath much received\nAnd renders nothing back.\nWas it for this\nThat one, the fairest of all rivers, loved\nTo blend his murmurs with my nurse's song,\nAnd, from his alder shades and rocky falls,\nAnd from his fords and shallows, sent a voice\nThat flowed along my dreams? For this, didst thou,\nO Derwent! winding among grassy holms\nWhere I was looking on, a babe in arms,\nMake ceaseless music that composed my thoughts\nTo more than infant softness, giving me\nAmid the fretful dwellings of mankind\nA foretaste, a dim earnest, of the calm\nThat Nature breathes among the hills and groves.\nWhen he had left the mountains and received\nOn his smooth breast the shadow of those towers\nThat yet survive, a shattered monument\nOf feudal sway, the bright blue river passed\nAlong the margin of our terrace walk;\nA tempting playmate whom we dearly loved.\nOh, many a time have I, a five years' child,\nIn a small mill-race severed from his stream,\nMade one long bathing of a summer's day;\nBasked in the sun, and plunged and basked again\nAlternate, all a summer's day, or scoured\nThe sandy fields, leaping through flowery groves\nOf yellow ragwort; or, when rock and hill,\nThe woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,\nWere bronzed with deepest radiance, stood alone\nBeneath the sky, as if I had been born\nOn Indian plains, and from my mother's hut\nHad run abroad in wantonness, to sport\nA naked savage, in the thunder shower.\nFair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up\nFostered alike by beauty and by fear:\nMuch favoured in my birth-place, and no less\nIn that beloved Vale to which erelong\nWe were transplanted;--there were we let loose\nFor sports of wider range. Ere I had told\nTen birth-days, when among the mountain slopes\nFrost, and the breath of frosty wind, had snapped\nThe last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy\nWith store of springes o'er my shoulder hung\nTo range the open heights where woodcocks run\nAlong the smooth green turf. Through half the night,\nScudding away from snare to snare, I plied\nThat anxious visitation;--moon and stars\nWere shining o'er my head. I was alone,\nAnd seemed to be a trouble to the peace\nThat dwelt among them. Sometimes it befell\nIn these night wanderings, that a strong desire\nO'erpowered my better reason, and the bird\nWhich was the captive of another's toil\nBecame my prey; and when the deed was done\nI heard among the solitary hills\nLow breathings coming after me, and sounds\nOf undistinguishable motion, steps\nAlmost as silent as the turf they trod.\nNor less, when spring had warmed the cultured Vale,\nMoved we as plunderers where the mother-bird\nHad in high places built her lodge; though mean\nOur object and inglorious, yet the end\nWas not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung\nAbove the raven's nest, by knots of grass\nAnd half-inch fissures in the slippery rock\nBut ill sustained, and almost (so it seemed)\nSuspended by the blast that blew amain,\nShouldering the naked crag, oh, at that time\nWhile on the perilous ridge I hung alone,\nWith what strange utterance did the loud dry wind\nBlow through my ear! the sky seemed not a sky\nOf earth--and with what motion moved the clouds!\nDust as we are, the immortal spirit grows\nLike harmony in music; there is a dark\nInscrutable workmanship that reconciles\nDiscordant elements, makes them cling together\nIn one society. How strange, that all\nThe terrors, pains, and early miseries,\nRegrets, vexations, lassitudes interfused\nWithin my mind, should e'er have borne a part,\nAnd that a needful part, in making up\nThe calm existence that is mine when I\nAm worthy of myself! Praise to the end!\nThanks to the means which Nature deigned to employ;\nWhether her fearless visitings, or those\nThat came with soft alarm, like hurtless light\nOpening the peaceful clouds; or she would use\nSeverer interventions, ministry\nMore palpable, as best might suit her aim.\nOne summer evening (led by her) I found\nA little boat tied to a willow tree\nWithin a rocky cave, its usual home.\nStraight I unloosed her chain, and stepping in\nPushed from the shore. It was an act of stealth\nAnd troubled pleasure, nor without the voice\nOf mountain-echoes did my boat move on;\nLeaving behind her still, on either side,\nSmall circles glittering idly in the moon,\nUntil they melted all into one track\nOf sparkling light. But now, like one who rows,\nProud of his skill, to reach a chosen point\nWith an unswerving line, I fixed my view\nUpon the summit of a craggy ridge,\nThe horizon's utmost boundary; far above\nWas nothing but the stars and the grey sky.\nShe was an elfin pinnace; lustily\nI dipped my oars into the silent lake,\nAnd, as I rose upon the stroke, my boat\nWent heaving through the water like a swan;\nWhen, from behind that craggy steep till then\nThe horizon's bound, a huge peak, black and huge,\nAs if with voluntary power instinct,\nUpreared its head. I struck and struck again,\nAnd growing still in stature the grim shape\nTowered up between me and the stars, and still,\nFor so it seemed, with purpose of its own\nAnd measured motion like a living thing,\nStrode after me. With trembling oars I turned,\nAnd through the silent water stole my way\nBack to the covert of the willow tree;\nThere in her mooring-place I left my bark,--\nAnd through the meadows homeward went, in grave\nAnd serious mood; but after I had seen\nThat spectacle, for many days, my brain\nWorked with a dim and undetermined sense\nOf unknown modes of being; o'er my thoughts\nThere hung a darkness, call it solitude\nOr blank desertion. No familiar shapes\nRemained, no pleasant images of trees,\nOf sea or sky, no colours of green fields;\nBut huge and mighty forms, that do not live\nLike living men, moved slowly through the mind\nBy day, and were a trouble to my dreams.\nWisdom and Spirit of the universe!\nThou Soul that art the eternity of thought\nThat givest to forms and images a breath\nAnd everlasting motion, not in vain\nBy day or star-light thus from my first dawn\nOf childhood didst thou intertwine for me\nThe passions that build up our human soul;\nNot with the mean and vulgar works of man,\nBut with high objects, with enduring things--\nWith life and nature--purifying thus\nThe elements of feeling and of thought,\nAnd sanctifying, by such discipline,\nBoth pain and fear, until we recognise\nA grandeur in the beatings of the heart.\nNor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me\nWith stinted kindness. In November days,\nWhen vapours rolling down the valley made\nA lonely scene more lonesome, among woods,\nAt noon and 'mid the calm of summer nights,\nWhen, by the margin of the trembling lake,\nBeneath the gloomy hills homeward I went\nIn solitude, such intercourse was mine;\nMine was it in the fields both day and night,\nAnd by the waters, all the summer long.\nAnd in the frosty season, when the sun\nWas set, and visible for many a mile\nThe cottage windows blazed through twilight gloom,\nI heeded not their summons: happy time\nIt was indeed for all of us--for me\nIt was a time of rapture! Clear and loud\nThe village clock tolled six,--I wheeled about,\nProud and exulting like an untired horse\nThat cares not for his home. All shod with steel,\nWe hissed along the polished ice in games\nConfederate, imitative of the chase\nAnd woodland pleasures,--the resounding horn,\nThe pack loud chiming, and the hunted hare.\nSo through the darkness and the cold we flew,\nAnd not a voice was idle; with the din\nSmitten, the precipices rang aloud;\nThe leafless trees and every icy crag\nTinkled like iron; while far distant hills\nInto the tumult sent an alien sound\nOf melancholy not unnoticed, while the stars\nEastward were sparkling clear, and in the west\nThe orange sky of evening died away.\nNot seldom from the uproar I retired\nInto a silent bay, or sportively\nGlanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,\nTo cut across the reflex of a star\nThat fled, and, flying still before me, gleamed\nUpon the glassy plain; and oftentimes,\nWhen we had given our bodies to the wind,\nAnd all the shadowy banks on either side\nCame sweeping through the darkness, spinning still\nThe rapid line of motion, then at once\nHave I, reclining back upon my heels,\nStopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs\nWheeled by me--even as if the earth had rolled\nWith visible motion her diurnal round!\nBehind me did they stretch in solemn train,\nFeebler and feebler, and I stood and watched\nTill all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.\nYe Presences of Nature in the sky\nAnd on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!\nAnd Souls of lonely places! can I think\nA vulgar hope was yours when ye employed\nSuch ministry, when ye, through many a year\nHaunting me thus among my boyish sports,\nOn caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,\nImpressed, upon all forms, the characters\nOf danger or desire; and thus did make\nThe surface of the universal earth,\nWith triumph and delight, with hope and fear,\nWork like a sea?\nNot uselessly employed,\nMight I pursue this theme through every change\nOf exercise and play, to which the year\nDid summon us in his delightful round.\nWe were a noisy crew; the sun in heaven\nBeheld not vales more beautiful than ours;\nNor saw a band in happiness and joy\nRicher, or worthier of the ground they trod.\nI could record with no reluctant voice\nThe woods of autumn, and their hazel bowers\nWith milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,\nTrue symbol of hope's foolishness, whose strong\nAnd unreproved enchantment led us on\nBy rocks and pools shut out from every star,\nAll the green summer, to forlorn cascades\nAmong the windings hid of mountain brooks.\n--Unfading recollections! at this hour\nThe heart is almost mine with which I felt,\nFrom some hill-top on sunny afternoons,\nThe paper kite high among fleecy clouds\nPull at her rein like an impetuous courser;\nOr, from the meadows sent on gusty days,\nBeheld her breast the wind, then suddenly\nDashed headlong, and rejected by the storm.\nYe lowly cottages wherein we dwelt,\nA ministration of your own was yours;\nCan I forget you, being as you were\nSo beautiful among the pleasant fields\nIn which ye stood? or can I here forget\nThe plain and seemly countenance with which\nYe dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye\nDelights and exultations of your own.\nEager and never weary we pursued\nOur home-amusements by the warm peat-fire\nAt evening, when with pencil, and smooth slate\nIn square divisions parcelled out and all\nWith crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,\nWe schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head\nIn strife too humble to be named in verse:\nOr round the naked table, snow-white deal,\nCherry or maple, sate in close array,\nAnd to the combat, Loo or Whist, led on\nA thick-ribbed army; not, as in the world,\nNeglected and ungratefully thrown by\nEven for the very service they had wrought,\nBut husbanded through many a long campaign.\nUncouth assemblage was it, where no few\nHad changed their functions: some, plebeian cards\nWhich Fate, beyond the promise of their birth,\nHad dignified, and called to represent\nThe persons of departed potentates.\nOh, with what echoes on the board they fell!\nIronic diamonds,--clubs, hearts, diamonds, spades,\nA congregation piteously akin!\nCheap matter offered they to boyish wit,\nThose sooty knaves, precipitated down\nWith scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of heaven:\nThe paramount ace, a moon in her eclipse,\nQueens gleaming through their splendour's last decay,\nAnd monarchs surly at the wrongs sustained\nBy royal visages. Meanwhile abroad\nIncessant rain was falling, or the frost\nRaged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth;\nAnd, interrupting oft that eager game,\nFrom under Esthwaite's splitting fields of ice\nThe pent-up air, struggling to free itself,\nGave out to meadow grounds and hills a loud\nProtracted yelling, like the noise of wolves\nHowling in troops along the Bothnic Main.\nNor, sedulous as I have been to trace\nHow Nature by extrinsic passion first\nPeopled the mind with forms sublime or fair,\nAnd made me love them, may I here omit\nHow other pleasures have been mine, and joys\nOf subtler origin; how I have felt,\nNot seldom even in that tempestuous time,\nThose hallowed and pure motions of the sense\nWhich seem, in their simplicity, to own\nAn intellectual charm; that calm delight\nWhich, if I err not, surely must belong\nTo those first-born affinities that fit\nOur new existence to existing things,\nAnd, in our dawn of being, constitute\nThe bond of union between life and joy.\nYes, I remember when the changeful earth,\nAnd twice five summers on my mind had stamped\nThe faces of the moving year, even then\nI held unconscious intercourse with beauty\nOld as creation, drinking in a pure\nOrganic pleasure from the silver wreaths\nOf curling mist, or from the level plain\nOf waters coloured by impending clouds.\nThe sands of Westmoreland, the creeks and bays\nOf Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell\nHow, when the Sea threw off his evening shade,\nAnd to the shepherd's hut on distant hills\nSent welcome notice of the rising moon,\nHow I have stood, to fancies such as these\nA stranger, linking with the spectacle\nNo conscious memory of a kindred sight,\nAnd bringing with me no peculiar sense\nOf quietness or peace; yet have I stood,\nEven while mine eye hath moved o'er many a league\nOf shining water, gathering as it seemed,\nThrough every hair-breadth in that field of light,\nNew pleasure like a bee among the flowers.\nThus oft amid those fits of vulgar joy\nWhich, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits\nAre prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss\nWhich, like a tempest, works along the blood\nAnd is forgotten; even then I felt\nGleams like the flashing of a shield;--the earth\nAnd common face of Nature spake to me\nRememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,\nBy chance collisions and quaint accidents\n(Like those ill-sorted unions, work supposed\nOf evil-minded fairies), yet not vain\nNor profitless, if haply they impressed\nCollateral objects and appearances,\nAlbeit lifeless then, and doomed to sleep\nUntil maturer seasons called them forth\nTo impregnate and to elevate the mind.\n--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight\nWearied itself out of the memory,\nThe scenes which were a witness of that joy\nRemained in their substantial lineaments\nDepicted on the brain, and to the eye\nWere visible, a daily sight; and thus\nBy the impressive discipline of fear,\nBy pleasure and repeated happiness,\nSo frequently repeated, and by force\nOf obscure feelings representative\nOf things forgotten, these same scenes so bright,\nSo beautiful, so majestic in themselves,\nThough yet the day was distant, did become\nHabitually dear, and all their forms\nAnd changeful colours by invisible links\nWere fastened to the affections.\nI began\nMy story early--not misled, I trust,\nBy an infirmity of love for days\nDisowned by memory--ere the breath of spring\nPlanting my snowdrops among winter snows:\nNor will it seem to thee, O Friend! so prompt\nIn sympathy, that I have lengthened out\nWith fond and feeble tongue a tedious tale.\nMeanwhile, my hope has been, that I might fetch\nInvigorating thoughts from former years;\nMight fix the wavering balance of my mind,\nAnd haply meet reproaches too, whose power\nMay spur me on, in manhood now mature\nTo honourable toil. Yet should these hopes\nProve vain, and thus should neither I be taught\nTo understand myself, nor thou to know\nWith better knowledge how the heart was framed\nOf him thou lovest; need I dread from thee\nHarsh judgments, if the song be loth to quit\nThose recollected hours that have the charm\nOf visionary things, those lovely forms\nAnd sweet sensations that throw back our life,\nAnd almost make remotest infancy\nA visible scene, on which the sun is shining?\nOne end at least hath been attained; my mind\nHath been revived, and if this genial mood\nDesert me not, forthwith shall be brought down\nThrough later years the story of my life.\nThe road lies plain before me;--'tis a theme\nSingle and of determined bounds; and hence\nI choose it rather at this time, than work\nOf ampler or more varied argument,\nWhere I might be discomfited and lost:\nAnd certain hopes are with me, that to thee\nThis labour will be welcome, honoured Friend!",

Wahonowin!\"\nBy the shores of Gitche Gumee,\nBy the shining Big-Sea-Water,\nStood the wigwam of Nokomis,\nDaughter of the Moon, Nokomis.\nDark behind it rose the forest,\nRose the black and gloomy pine-trees,\nRose the firs with cones upon them;\nBright before it beat the water,\nBeat the clear and sunny water,\nBeat the shining Big-Sea-Water.\nThere the wrinkled old Nokomis\nNursed the little Hiawatha,\nRocked him in his linden cradle,\nBedded soft in moss and rushes,\nSafely bound with reindeer sinews;\nStilled his fretful wail by saying,\n\"Hush! the Naked Bear will hear thee!\"\nLulled him into slumber, singing,\n\"Ewa-yea! my little owlet!\nWho is this, that lights the wigwam?\nWith his great eyes lights the wigwam?\nEwa-yea! my little owlet!\"\nMany things Nokomis taught him\nOf the stars that shine in heaven;\nShowed him Ishkoodah, the comet,\nIshkoodah, with fiery tresses;\nShowed the Death-Dance of the spirits,\nWarriors with their plumes and war-clubs,\nFlaring far away to northward\nIn the frosty nights of Winter;\nShowed the broad white road in heaven,\nPathway of the ghosts, the shadows,\nRunning straight across the heavens,\nCrowded with the ghosts, the shadows.\nAt the door on summer evenings\nSat the little Hiawatha;\nHeard the whispering of the pine-trees,\nHeard the lapping of the waters,\nSounds of music, words of wonder;\n'Minne-wawa!\" said the Pine-trees,\nMudway-aushka!\" said the water.\nSaw the fire-fly, Wah-wah-taysee,\nFlitting through the dusk of evening,\nWith the twinkle of its candle\nLighting up the brakes and bushes,\nAnd he sang the song of children,\nSang the song Nokomis taught him:\n\"Wah-wah-taysee, little fire-fly,\nLittle, flitting, white-fire insect,\nLittle, dancing, white-fire creature,\nLight me with your little candle,\nEre upon my bed I lay me,\nEre in sleep I close my eyelids!\"\nSaw the moon rise from the water\nRippling, rounding from the water,\nSaw the flecks and shadows on it,\nWhispered, \"What is that, Nokomis?\"\nAnd the good Nokomis answered:\n\"Once a warrior, very angry,\nSeized his grandmother, and threw her\nUp into the sky at midnight;\nRight against the moon he threw her;\n'T is her body that you see there.\"\nSaw the rainbow in the heaven,\nIn the eastern sky, the rainbow,\nWhispered, \"What is that, Nokomis?\"\nAnd the good Nokomis answered:\n\"'T is the heaven of flowers you see there;\nAll the wild-flowers of the forest,\nAll the lilies of the prairie,\nWhen on earth they fade and perish,\nBlossom in that heaven above us.\"\nWhen he heard the owls at midnight,\nHooting, laughing in the forest,\n'What is that?\" he cried in terror,\n\"What is that,\" he said, \"Nokomis?\"\nAnd the good Nokomis answered:\n\"That is but the owl and owlet,\nTalking in their native language,\nTalking, scolding at each other.\"\nThen the little Hiawatha\nLearned of every bird its language,\nLearned their names and all their secrets,\nHow they built their nests in Summer,\nWhere they hid themselves in Winter,\nTalked with them whene'er he met them,\nCalled them \"Hiawatha's Chickens.\"\nOf all beasts he learned the language,\nLearned their names and all their secrets,\nHow the beavers built their lodges,\nWhere the squirrels hid their acorns,\nHow the reindeer ran so swiftly,\nWhy the rabbit was so timid,\nTalked with them whene'er he met them,\nCalled them \"Hiawatha's Brothers.\"\nThen Iagoo, the great boaster,\nHe the marvellous story-teller,\nHe the traveller and the talker,\nHe the friend of old Nokomis,\nMade a bow for Hiawatha;\nFrom a branch of ash he made it,\nFrom an oak-bough made the arrows,\nTipped with flint, and winged with feathers,\nAnd the cord he made of deer-skin.\nThen he said to Hiawatha:\n\"Go, my son, into the forest,\nWhere the red deer herd together,\nKill for us a famous roebuck,\nKill for us a deer with antlers!\"\nForth into the forest straightway\nAll alone walked Hiawatha\nProudly, with his bow and arrows;\nAnd the birds sang round him, o'er him,\n\"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!\"\nSang the robin, the Opechee,\nSang the bluebird, the Owaissa,\n\"Do not shoot us, Hiawatha!\"\nUp the oak-tree, close beside him,\nSprang the squirrel, Adjidaumo,\nIn and out among the branches,\nCoughed and chattered from the oak-tree,\nLaughed, and said between his laughing,\n\"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!\"\nAnd the rabbit from his pathway\nLeaped aside, and at a distance\nSat erect upon his haunches,\nHalf in fear and half in frolic,\nSaying to the little hunter,\n\"Do not shoot me, Hiawatha!\"\nBut he heeded not, nor heard them,\nFor his thoughts were with the red deer;\nOn their tracks his eyes were fastened,\nLeading downward to the river,\nTo the ford across the river,\nAnd as one in slumber walked he.\nHidden in the alder-bushes,\nThere he waited till the deer came,\nTill he saw two antlers lifted,\nSaw two eyes look from the thicket,\nSaw two nostrils point to windward,\nAnd a deer came down the pathway,\nFlecked with leafy light and shadow.\nAnd his heart within him fluttered,\nTrembled like the leaves above him,\nLike the birch-leaf palpitated,\nAs the deer came down the pathway.\nThen, upon one knee uprising,\nHiawatha aimed an arrow;\nScarce a twig moved with his motion,\nScarce a leaf was stirred or rustled,\nBut the wary roebuck started,\nStamped with all his hoofs together,\nListened with one foot uplifted,\nLeaped as if to meet the arrow;\nAh! the singing, fatal arrow,\nLike a wasp it buzzed and stung him!\nDead he lay there in the forest,\nBy the ford across the river;\nBeat his timid heart no longer,\nBut the heart of Hiawatha\nThrobbed and shouted and exulted,\nAs he bore the red deer homeward,\nAnd Iagoo and Nokomis\nHailed his coming with applauses.\nFrom the red deer's hide Nokomis\nMade a cloak for Hiawatha,\nFrom the red deer's flesh Nokomis\nMade a banquet to his honor.\nAll the village came and feasted,\nAll the guests praised Hiawatha,\nCalled him Strong-Heart, Soan-ge-taha!\nCalled him Loon-Heart, Mahn-go-taysee!",

For this, didst Thou,\nO Derwent! travelling over the green Plains\nNear my 'sweet Birthplace', didst thou, beauteous Stream\nMake ceaseless music through the night and day\nWhich with its steady cadence, tempering\nOur human waywardness, compos'd my thoughts\nTo more than infant softness, giving me,\nAmong the fretful dwellings of mankind,\nA knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm\nThat Nature breathes among the hills and groves.\nWhen, having left his Mountains, to the Towers\nOf Cockermouth that beauteous River came,\nBehind my Father's House he pass'd, close by,\nAlong the margin of our Terrace Walk.\nHe was a Playmate whom we dearly lov'd.\nOh! many a time have I, a five years' Child,\nA naked Boy, in one delightful Rill,\nA little Mill-race sever'd from his stream,\nMade one long bathing of a summer's day,\nBask'd in the sun, and plunged, and bask'd again\nAlternate all a summer's day, or cours'd\nOver the sandy fields, leaping through groves\nOf yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,\nThe woods, and distant Skiddaw's lofty height,\nWere bronz'd with a deep radiance, stood alone\nBeneath the sky, as if I had been born\nOn Indian Plains, and from my Mother's hut\nHad run abroad in wantonness, to sport,\nA naked Savage, in the thunder shower.\nFair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up\nFoster'd alike by beauty and by fear;\nMuch favour'd in my birthplace, and no less\nIn that beloved Vale to which, erelong,\nI was transplanted. Well I call to mind\n('Twas at an early age, ere I had seen\nNine summers) when upon the mountain slope\nThe frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp'd\nThe last autumnal crocus, 'twas my joy\nTo wander half the night among the Cliffs\nAnd the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran\nAlong the open turf. In thought and wish\nThat time, my shoulder all with springes hung,\nI was a fell destroyer. On the heights\nScudding away from snare to snare, I plied\nMy anxious visitation, hurrying on,\nStill hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars\nWere shining o'er my head; I was alone,\nAnd seem'd to be a trouble to the peace\nThat was among them. Sometimes it befel\nIn these night-wanderings, that a strong desire\nO'erpower'd my better reason, and the bird\nWhich was the captive of another's toils\nBecame my prey; and, when the deed was done\nI heard among the solitary hills\nLow breathings coming after me, and sounds\nOf undistinguishable motion, steps\nAlmost as silent as the turf they trod.\nNor less in springtime when on southern banks\nThe shining sun had from his knot of leaves\nDecoy'd the primrose flower, and when the Vales\nAnd woods were warm, was I a plunderer then\nIn the high places, on the lonesome peaks\nWhere'er, among the mountains and the winds,\nThe Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean\nMy object, and inglorious, yet the end\nWas not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung\nAbove the raven's nest, by knots of grass\nAnd half-inch fissures in the slippery rock\nBut ill sustain'd, and almost, as it seem'd,\nSuspended by the blast which blew amain,\nShouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time,\nWhile on the perilous ridge I hung alone,\nWith what strange utterance did the loud dry wind\nBlow through my ears! the sky seem'd not a sky\nOf earth, and with what motion mov'd the clouds!\nThe mind of Man is fram'd even like the breath\nAnd harmony of music. There is a dark\nInvisible workmanship that reconciles\nDiscordant elements, and makes them move\nIn one society. Ah me! that all\nThe terrors, all the early miseries\nRegrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all\nThe thoughts and feelings which have been infus'd\nInto my mind, should ever have made up\nThe calm existence that is mine when I\nAm worthy of myself! Praise to the end!\nThanks likewise for the means! But I believe\nThat Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame\nA favor'd Being, from his earliest dawn\nOf infancy doth open out the clouds,\nAs at the touch of lightning, seeking him\nWith gentlest visitation; not the less,\nThough haply aiming at the self-same end,\nDoes it delight her sometimes to employ\nSeverer interventions, ministry\nMore palpable, and so she dealt with me.\nOne evening (surely I was led by her)\nI went alone into a Shepherd's Boat,\nA Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied\nWithin a rocky Cave, its usual home.\n'Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale\nWherein I was a Stranger, thither come\nA School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays.\nForth rambled from the Village Inn alone\nNo sooner had I sight of this small Skiff,\nDiscover'd thus by unexpected chance,\nThan I unloos'd her tether and embark'd.\nThe moon was up, the Lake was shining clear\nAmong the hoary mountains; from the Shore\nI push'd, and struck the oars and struck again\nIn cadence, and my little Boat mov'd on\nEven like a Man who walks with stately step\nThough bent on speed. It was an act of stealth\nAnd troubled pleasure; not without the voice\nOf mountain-echoes did my Boat move on,\nLeaving behind her still on either side\nSmall circles glittering idly in the moon,\nUntil they melted all into one track\nOf sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose\nAbove the Cavern of the Willow tree\nAnd now, as suited one who proudly row'd\nWith his best skill, I fix'd a steady view\nUpon the top of that same craggy ridge,\nThe bound of the horizon, for behind\nWas nothing but the stars and the grey sky.\nShe was an elfin Pinnace; lustily\nI dipp'd my oars into the silent Lake,\nAnd, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat\nWent heaving through the water, like a Swan;\nWhen from behind that craggy Steep, till then\nThe bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff,\nAs if with voluntary power instinct,\nUprear'd its head. I struck, and struck again\nAnd, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff\nRose up between me and the stars, and still,\nWith measur'd motion, like a living thing,\nStrode after me. With trembling hands I turn'd,\nAnd through the silent water stole my way\nBack to the Cavern of the Willow tree.\nThere, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark,\nAnd, through the meadows homeward went, with grave\nAnd serious thoughts; and after I had seen\nThat spectacle, for many days, my brain\nWork'd with a dim and undetermin'd sense\nOf unknown modes of being; in my thoughts\nThere was a darkness, call it solitude,\nOr blank desertion, no familiar shapes\nOf hourly objects, images of trees,\nOf sea or sky, no colours of green fields;\nBut huge and mighty Forms that do not live\nLike living men mov'd slowly through the mind\nBy day and were the trouble of my dreams.\nWisdom and Spirit of the universe!\nThou Soul that art the eternity of thought!\nThat giv'st to forms and images a breath\nAnd everlasting motion! not in vain,\nBy day or star-light thus from my first dawn\nOf Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me\nThe passions that build up our human Soul,\nNot with the mean and vulgar works of Man,\nBut with high objects, with enduring things,\nWith life and nature, purifying thus\nThe elements of feeling and of thought,\nAnd sanctifying, by such discipline,\nBoth pain and fear, until we recognize\nA grandeur in the beatings of the heart.\nNor was this fellowship vouchsaf'd to me\nWith stinted kindness. In November days,\nWhen vapours, rolling down the valleys, made\nA lonely scene more lonesome; among woods\nAt noon, and 'mid the calm of summer nights,\nWhen, by the margin of the trembling Lake,\nBeneath the gloomy hills I homeward went\nIn solitude, such intercourse was mine;\n'Twas mine among the fields both day and night,\nAnd by the waters all the summer long.\nAnd in the frosty season, when the sun\nWas set, and visible for many a mile\nThe cottage windows through the twilight blaz'd,\nI heeded not the summons:--happy time\nIt was, indeed, for all of us; to me\nIt was a time of rapture: clear and loud\nThe village clock toll'd six; I wheel'd about,\nProud and exulting, like an untired horse,\nThat cares not for its home.--All shod with steel,\nWe hiss'd along the polish'd ice, in games\nConfederate, imitative of the chace\nAnd woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,\nThe Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.\nSo through the darkness and the cold we flew,\nAnd not a voice was idle; with the din,\nMeanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,\nThe leafless trees, and every icy crag\nTinkled like iron, while the distant hills\nInto the tumult sent an alien sound\nOf melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,\nEastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west\nThe orange sky of evening died away.\nNot seldom from the uproar I retired\nInto a silent bay, or sportively\nGlanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,\nTo cut across the image of a star\nThat gleam'd upon the ice: and oftentimes\nWhen we had given our bodies to the wind,\nAnd all the shadowy banks, on either side,\nCame sweeping through the darkness, spinning still\nThe rapid line of motion; then at once\nHave I, reclining back upon my heels,\nStopp'd short, yet still the solitary Cliffs\nWheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll'd\nWith visible motion her diurnal round;\nBehind me did they stretch in solemn train\nFeebler and feebler, and I stood and watch'd\nTill all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.\nYe Presences of Nature, in the sky\nAnd on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills!\nAnd Souls of lonely places! can I think\nA vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ'd\nSuch ministry, when Ye through many a year\nHaunting me thus among my boyish sports,\nOn caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,\nImpress'd upon all forms the characters\nOf danger or desire, and thus did make\nThe surface of the universal earth\nWith triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,\nWork like a sea?       Not uselessly employ'd,\nI might pursue this theme through every change\nOf exercise and play, to which the year\nDid summon us in its delightful round.\nWe were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven\nBeheld not vales more beautiful than ours,\nNor saw a race in happiness and joy\nMore worthy of the ground where they were sown.\nI would record with no reluctant voice\nThe woods of autumn and their hazel bowers\nWith milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,\nTrue symbol of the foolishness of hope,\nWhich with its strong enchantment led us on\nBy rocks and pools, shut out from every star\nAll the green summer, to forlorn cascades\nAmong the windings of the mountain brooks.\n--Unfading recollections! at this hour\nThe heart is almost mine with which I felt\nFrom some hill-top, on sunny afternoons\nThe Kite high up among the fleecy clouds\nPull at its rein, like an impatient Courser,\nOr, from the meadows sent on gusty days,\nBeheld her breast the wind, then suddenly\nDash'd headlong; and rejected by the storm.\nYe lowly Cottages in which we dwelt,\nA ministration of your own was yours,\nA sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!\nCan I forget you, being as ye were\nSo beautiful among the pleasant fields\nIn which ye stood? Or can I here forget\nThe plain and seemly countenance with which\nYe dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye\nDelights and exultations of your own.\nEager and never weary we pursued\nOur home amusements by the warm peat-fire\nAt evening; when with pencil and with slate,\nIn square divisions parcell'd out, and all\nWith crosses and with cyphers scribbled o'er,\nWe schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head\nIn strife too humble to be named in Verse.\nOr round the naked table, snow-white deal,\nCherry or maple, sate in close array,\nAnd to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on\nthick-ribbed Army; not as in the world\nNeglected and ungratefully thrown by\nEven for the very service they had wrought,\nBut husbanded through many a long campaign.\nUncouth assemblage was it, where no few\nHad changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,\nWhich Fate beyond the promise of their birth\nHad glorified, and call'd to represent\nThe persons of departed Potentates.\nOh! with what echoes on the Board they fell!\nIronic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades,\nA congregation piteously akin.\nCheap matter did they give to boyish wit,\nThose sooty knaves, precipitated down\nWith scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven,\nThe paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse,\nQueens, gleaming through their splendour's last decay,\nAnd Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain'd\nBy royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad\nThe heavy rain was falling, or the frost\nRaged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,\nAnd, interrupting oft the impassion'd game,\nFrom Esthwaite's neighbouring Lake the splitting ice,\nWhile it sank down towards the water, sent,\nAmong the meadows and the hills, its long\nAnd dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves\nWhen they are howling round the Bothnic Main.\nNor, sedulous as I have been to trace\nHow Nature by extrinsic passion first\nPeopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,\nAnd made me love them, may I well forget\nHow other pleasures have been mine, and joys\nOf subtler origin; how I have felt,\nNot seldom, even in that tempestuous time,\nThose hallow'd and pure motions of the sense\nWhich seem, in their simplicity, to own\nAn intellectual charm, that calm delight\nWhich, if I err not, surely must belong\nTo those first-born affinities that fit\nOur new existence to existing things,\nAnd, in our dawn of being, constitute\nThe bond of union betwixt life and joy.\nYes, I remember, when the changeful earth,\nAnd twice five seasons on my mind had stamp'd\nThe faces of the moving year, even then,\nA Child, I held unconscious intercourse\nWith the eternal Beauty, drinking in\nA pure organic pleasure from the lines\nOf curling mist, or from the level plain\nOf waters colour'd by the steady clouds.\nThe Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays\nOf Cumbria's rocky limits, they can tell\nHow when the Sea threw off his evening shade\nAnd to the Shepherd's huts beneath the crags\nDid send sweet notice of the rising moon,\nHow I have stood, to fancies such as these,\nEngrafted in the tenderness of thought,\nA stranger, linking with the spectacle\nNo conscious memory of a kindred sight,\nAnd bringing with me no peculiar sense\nOf quietness or peace, yet I have stood,\nEven while mine eye has mov'd o'er three long leagues\nOf shining water, gathering, as it seem'd,\nThrough every hair-breadth of that field of light,\nNew pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.\nThus, often in those fits of vulgar joy\nWhich, through all seasons, on a child's pursuits\nAre prompt attendants, 'mid that giddy bliss\nWhich, like a tempest, works along the blood\nAnd is forgotten; even then I felt\nGleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth\nAnd common face of Nature spake to me\nRememberable things; sometimes, 'tis true,\nBy chance collisions and quaint accidents\nLike those ill-sorted unions, work suppos'd\nOf evil-minded fairies, yet not vain\nNor profitless, if haply they impress'd\nCollateral objects and appearances,\nAlbeit lifeless then, and doom'd to sleep\nUntil maturer seasons call'd them forth\nTo impregnate and to elevate the mind.\n--And if the vulgar joy by its own weight\nWearied itself out of the memory,\nThe scenes which were a witness of that joy\nRemained, in their substantial lineaments\nDepicted on the brain, and to the eye\nWere visible, a daily sight; and thus\nBy the impressive discipline of fear,\nBy pleasure and repeated happiness,\nSo frequently repeated, and by force\nOf obscure feelings representative\nOf joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,\nSo beauteous and majestic in themselves,\nThough yet the day was distant, did at length\nBecome habitually dear, and all\nTheir hues and forms were by invisible links\nAllied to the affections.       I began\nMy story early, feeling as I fear,\nThe weakness of a human love, for days\nDisown'd by memory, ere the birth of spring\nPlanting my snowdrops among winter snows.\nNor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt\nIn sympathy, that I have lengthen'd out,\nWith fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale.\nMeanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch\nInvigorating thoughts from former years,\nMight fix the wavering balance of my wind,\nAnd haply meet reproaches, too, whose power\nMay spur me on, in manhood now mature,\nTo honorable toil. Yet should these hopes\nBe vain, and thus should neither I be taught\nTo understand myself, nor thou to know\nWith better knowledge how the heart was fram'd\nOf him thou lovest, need I dread from thee\nHarsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit\nThose recollected hours that have the charm\nOf visionary things, and lovely forms\nAnd sweet sensations that throw back our life\nAnd almost make our Infancy itself\nA visible scene, on which the sun is shining?\nOne end hereby at least hath been attain'd,\nMy mind hath been revived, and if this mood\nDesert me not, I will forthwith bring down,\nThrough later years, the story of my life.\nThe road lies plain before me; 'tis a theme\nSingle and of determined bounds; and hence\nI chuse it rather at this time, than work\nOf ampler or more varied argument.",

Oh farther than everything.\nIt is the hour of departure. Oh abandoned one!",

        "text": "Therefore death to us\nIs nothing, nor concerns us in the least,\nSince nature of mind is mortal evermore.\nAnd just as in the ages gone before\nWe felt no touch of ill, when all sides round\nTo battle came the Carthaginian host,\nAnd the times, shaken by tumultuous war,\nUnder the aery coasts of arching heaven\nShuddered and trembled, and all humankind\nDoubted to which the empery should fall\nBy land and sea, thus when we are no more,\nWhen comes that sundering of our body and soul\nThrough which we're fashioned to a single state,\nVerily naught to us, us then no more,\nCan come to pass, naught move our senses then-\nNo, not if earth confounded were with sea,\nAnd sea with heaven. But if indeed do feel\nThe nature of mind and energy of soul,\nAfter their severance from this body of ours,\nYet nothing 'tis to us who in the bonds\nAnd wedlock of the soul and body live,\nThrough which we're fashioned to a single state.\nAnd, even if time collected after death\nThe matter of our frames and set it all\nAgain in place as now, and if again\nTo us the light of life were given, O yet\nThat process too would not concern us aught,\nWhen once the self-succession of our sense\nHas been asunder broken. And now and here,\nLittle enough we're busied with the selves\nWe were aforetime, nor, concerning them,\nSuffer a sore distress. For shouldst thou gaze\nBackwards across all yesterdays of time\nThe immeasurable, thinking how manifold\nThe motions of matter are, then couldst thou well\nCredit this too: often these very seeds\n(From which we are to-day) of old were set\nIn the same order as they are to-day-\nYet this we can't to consciousness recall\nThrough the remembering mind. For there hath been\nAn interposed pause of life, and wide\nHave all the motions wandered everywhere\nFrom these our senses. For if woe and ail\nPerchance are toward, then the man to whom\nThe bane can happen must himself be there\nAt that same time. But death precludeth this,\nForbidding life to him on whom might crowd\nSuch irk and care; and granted 'tis to know:\nNothing for us there is to dread in death,\nNo wretchedness for him who is no more,\nThe same estate as if ne'er born before,\nWhen death immortal hath ta'en the mortal life.\nHence, where thou seest a man to grieve because\nWhen dead he rots with body laid away,\nOr perishes in flames or jaws of beasts,\nKnow well: he rings not true, and that beneath\nStill works an unseen sting upon his heart,\nHowever he deny that he believes.\nHis shall be aught of feeling after death.\nFor he, I fancy, grants not what he says,\nNor what that presupposes, and he fails\nTo pluck himself with all his roots from life\nAnd cast that self away, quite unawares\nFeigning that some remainder's left behind.\nFor when in life one pictures to oneself\nHis body dead by beasts and vultures torn,\nHe pities his state, dividing not himself\nTherefrom, removing not the self enough\nFrom the body flung away, imagining\nHimself that body, and projecting there\nHis own sense, as he stands beside it: hence\nHe grieves that he is mortal born, nor marks\nThat in true death there is no second self\nAlive and able to sorrow for self destroyed,\nOr stand lamenting that the self lies there\nMangled or burning. For if it an evil is\nDead to be jerked about by jaw and fang\nOf the wild brutes, I see not why 'twere not\nBitter to lie on fires and roast in flames,\nOr suffocate in honey, and, reclined\nOn the smooth oblong of an icy slab,\nGrow stiff in cold, or sink with load of earth\nDown-crushing from above.\n\"Thee now no more\nThe joyful house and best of wives shall welcome,\nNor little sons run up to snatch their kisses\nAnd touch with silent happiness thy heart.\nThou shalt not speed in undertakings more,\nNor be the warder of thine own no more.\nPoor wretch,\" they say, \"one hostile hour hath ta'en\nWretchedly from thee all life's many guerdons,\"\nBut add not, \"yet no longer unto thee\nRemains a remnant of desire for them\"\nIf this they only well perceived with mind\nAnd followed up with maxims, they would free\nTheir state of man from anguish and from fear.\n\"O even as here thou art, aslumber in death,\nSo shalt thou slumber down the rest of time,\nReleased from every harrying pang. But we,\nWe have bewept thee with insatiate woe,\nStanding beside whilst on the awful pyre\nThou wert made ashes; and no day shall take\nFor us the eternal sorrow from the breast.\"\nBut ask the mourner what's the bitterness\nThat man should waste in an eternal grief,\nIf, after all, the thing's but sleep and rest?\nFor when the soul and frame together are sunk\nIn slumber, no one then demands his self\nOr being. Well, this sleep may be forever,\nWithout desire of any selfhood more,\nFor all it matters unto us asleep.\nYet not at all do those primordial germs\nRoam round our members, at that time, afar\nFrom their own motions that produce our senses-\nSince, when he's startled from his sleep, a man\nCollects his senses. Death is, then, to us\nMuch less- if there can be a less than that\nWhich is itself a nothing: for there comes\nHard upon death a scattering more great\nOf the throng of matter, and no man wakes up\nOn whom once falls the icy pause of life.\nThis too, O often from the soul men say,\nAlong their couches holding of the cups,\nWith faces shaded by fresh wreaths awry:\n\"Brief is this fruit of joy to paltry man,\nSoon, soon departed, and thereafter, no,\nIt may not be recalled.\"- As if, forsooth,\nIt were their prime of evils in great death\nTo parch, poor tongues, with thirst and arid drought,\nOr chafe for any lack.\nOnce more, if Nature\nShould of a sudden send a voice abroad,\nAnd her own self inveigh against us so:\n\"Mortal, what hast thou of such grave concern\nThat thou indulgest in too sickly plaints?\nWhy this bemoaning and beweeping death?\nFor if thy life aforetime and behind\nTo thee was grateful, and not all thy good\nWas heaped as in sieve to flow away\nAnd perish unavailingly, why not,\nEven like a banqueter, depart the halls,\nLaden with life? why not with mind content\nTake now, thou fool, thy unafflicted rest?\nBut if whatever thou enjoyed hath been\nLavished and lost, and life is now offence,\nWhy seekest more to add- which in its turn\nWill perish foully and fall out in vain?\nO why not rather make an end of life,\nOf labour? For all I may devise or find\nTo pleasure thee is nothing: all things are\nThe same forever. Though not yet thy body\nWrinkles with years, nor yet the frame exhausts\nOutworn, still things abide the same, even if\nThou goest on to conquer all of time\nWith length of days, yea, if thou never diest\"-\nWhat were our answer, but that Nature here\nUrges just suit and in her words lays down\nTrue cause of action? Yet should one complain,\nRiper in years and elder, and lament,\nPoor devil, his death more sorely than is fit,\nThen would she not, with greater right, on him\nCry out, inveighing with a voice more shrill:\n\"Off with thy tears, and choke thy whines, buffoon!\nThou wrinklest- after thou hast had the sum\nOf the guerdons of life; yet, since thou cravest ever\nWhat's not at hand, contemning present good,\nThat life has slipped away, unperfected\nAnd unavailing unto thee. And now,\nOr ere thou guessed it, death beside thy head\nStands- and before thou canst be going home\nSated and laden with the goodly feast.\nBut now yield all that's alien to thine age,-\nUp, with good grace! make room for sons: thou must.\"\nJustly, I fancy, would she reason thus,\nJustly inveigh and gird: since ever the old\nOutcrowded by the new gives way, and ever\nThe one thing from the others is repaired.\nNor no man is consigned to the abyss\nOf Tartarus, the black. For stuff must be,\nThat thus the after-generations grow,-\nThough these, their life completed, follow thee;\nAnd thus like thee are generations all-\nAlready fallen, or some time to fall.\nSo one thing from another rises ever;\nAnd in fee-simple life is given to none,\nBut unto all mere usufruct.\nLook back:\nNothing to us was all fore-passed eld\nOf time the eternal, ere we had a birth.\nAnd Nature holds this like a mirror up\nOf time-to-be when we are dead and gone.\nAnd what is there so horrible appears?\nNow what is there so sad about it all?\nIs't not serener far than any sleep?\nAnd, verily, those tortures said to be\nIn Acheron, the deep, they all are ours\nHere in this life. No Tantalus, benumbed\nWith baseless terror, as the fables tell,\nFears the huge boulder hanging in the air:\nBut, rather, in life an empty dread of gods\nUrges mortality, and each one fears\nSuch fall of fortune as may chance to him.\nNor eat the vultures into Tityus\nProstrate in Acheron, nor can they find,\nForsooth, throughout eternal ages, aught\nTo pry around for in that mighty breast.\nHowever hugely he extend his bulk-\nWho hath for outspread limbs not acres nine,\nBut the whole earth- he shall not able be\nTo bear eternal pain nor furnish food\nFrom his own frame forever. But for us\nA Tityus is he whom vultures rend\nProstrate in love, whom anxious anguish eats,\nWhom troubles of any unappeased desires\nAsunder rip. We have before our eyes\nHere in this life also a Sisyphus\nIn him who seeketh of the populace\nThe rods, the axes fell, and evermore\nRetires a beaten and a gloomy man.\nFor to seek after power- an empty name,\nNor given at all- and ever in the search\nTo endure a world of toil, O this it is\nTo shove with shoulder up the hill a stone\nWhich yet comes rolling back from off the top,\nAnd headlong makes for levels of the plain.\nThen to be always feeding an ingrate mind,\nFilling with good things, satisfying never-\nAs do the seasons of the year for us,\nWhen they return and bring their progenies\nAnd varied charms, and we are never filled\nWith the fruits of life- O this, I fancy, 'tis\nTo pour, like those young virgins in the tale,\nWaters into a sieve, unfilled forever.",

        "text": "So Eden was deserted, and at eve\nInto the quiet place God came to grieve.\nHis face was sad, His hands hung slackly down\nAlong his robe; too sorrowful to frown\nHe paced along the grassy paths and through\nThe silent trees, and where the flowers grew\nTended by Adam. All the birds had gone\nOut to the world, and singing was not one\nTo cheer the lonely God out of His grief --\nThe silence broken only when a leaf\nTapt lightly on a leaf, or when the wind,\nSlow-handed, swayed the bushes to its mind.\nAnd so along the base of a round hill,\nRolling in fern, He bent His way until\nHe neared the little hut which Adam made,\nAnd saw its dusky rooftree overlaid\nWith greenest leaves. Here Adam and his spouse\nWere wont to nestle in their little house\nSnug at the dew-time: here He, standing sad,\nSighed with the wind, nor any pleasure had\nIn heavenly knowledge, for His darlings twain\nHad gone from Him to learn the feel of pain,\nAnd what was meant by sorrow and despair, --\nDrear knowledge for a Father to prepare.\nThere he looked sadly on the little place;\nA beehive round it was, without a trace\nOf occupant or owner; standing dim\nAmong the gloomy trees it seemed to Him\nA final desolation, the last word\nWherewith the lips of silence had been stirred.\nChaste and remote, so tiny and so shy,\nSo new withal, so lost to any eye,\nSo pac't of memories all innocent\nOf days and nights that in it had been spent\nIn blithe communion, Adam, Eve, and He,\nAfar from Heaven and its gaudery;\nAnd now no more! He still must be the God\nBut not the friend; a Father with a rod\nWhose voice was fear, whose countenance a threat,\nWhose coming terror, and whose going wet\nWith penitential tears; not evermore\nWould they run forth to meet Him as before\nWith careless laughter, striving each to be\nFirst to His hand and dancing in their glee\nTo see Him coming -- they would hide instead\nAt His approach, or stand and hang the head,\nSpeaking in whispers, and would learn to pray\nInstead of asking, 'Father, if we may.'\nNever again to Eden would He haste\nAt cool of evening, when the sun had paced\nBack from the tree-tops, slanting from the rim\nOf a low cloud, what time the twilight dim\nKnit tree to tree in shadow, gathering slow\nTill all had met and vanished in the flow\nOf dusky silence, and a brooding star\nStared at the growing darkness from afar,\nWhile haply now and then some nested bird\nWould lift upon the air a sleepy word\nMost musical, or swing its airy bed\nTo the high moon that drifted overhead.\n'Twas good to quit at evening His great throne,\nTo lay His crown aside, and all alone\nDown through the quiet air to stoop and glide\nUnkenned by angels: silently to hide\nIn the green fields, by dappled shades, where brooks\nThrough leafy solitudes and quiet nooks\nFlowed far from heavenly majesty and pride,\nFrom light astounding and the wheeling tide\nOf roaring stars. Thus does it ever seem\nGood to the best to stay aside and dream\nIn narrow places, where the hand can feel\nSomething beside, and know that it is real.\nHis angels! silly creatures who could sing\nAnd sing again, and delicately fling\nThe smoky censer, bow and stand aside\nAll mute in adoration: thronging wide,\nTill nowhere could He look but soon He saw\nAn angel bending humbly to the law\nMechanic; knowing nothing more of pain,\nThan when they were forbid to sing again,\nOr swing anew the censer, or bow down\nIn humble adoration of His frown.\nThis was the thought in Eden as He trod --\n. . . It is a lonely thing to be a God.\nSo long! afar through Time He bent His mind,\nFor the beginning, which He could not find,\nThrough endless centuries and backwards still\nEndless forever, till His 'stonied will\nHalted in circles, dizzied in the swing\nOf mazy nothingness. -- His mind could bring\nNot to subjection, grip or hold the theme\nWhose wide horizon melted like a dream\nTo thinnest edges. Infinite behind\nThe piling centuries were trodden blind\nIn gulfs chaotic -- so He could not see\nWhen He was not who always had To Be.\nNot even godly fortitude can stare\nInto Eternity, nor easy bear\nThe insolent vacuity of Time:\nIt is too much, the mind can never climb\nUp to its meaning, for, without an end,\nWithout beginning, plan, or scope, or trend\nTo point a path, there nothing is to hold\nAnd steady surmise: so the mind is rolled\nAnd swayed and drowned in dull Immensity.\nEternity outfaces even Me\nWith its indifference, and the fruitless year\nWould swing as fruitless were I never there.\nAnd so for ever, day and night the same,\nYears flying swiftly nowhere, like a game\nPlayed random by a madman, without end\nOr any reasoned object but to spend\nWhat is unspendable -- Eternal Woe!\nO Weariness of Time that fast or slow\nGoes never further, never has in view\nAn ending to the thing it seeks to do,\nAnd so does nothing: merely ebb and flow,\nFrom nowhere into nowhere, touching so\nThe shores of many stars and passing on,\nCareless of what may come or what has gone.\nO solitude unspeakable! to be\nFor ever with oneself! never see\nAn equal face, or feel an equal hand,\nTo sit in state and issue reprimand,\nAdmonishment or glory, and to smile\nDisdaining what has happenèd the while!\nO to be breast to breast against a foe!\nAgainst a friend! to strive and not to know\nThe laboured outcome: love nor be aware\nHow much the other loved, and greatly care\nWith passion for that happy love or hate,\nNor know what joy or dole was hid in fate.\nFor I have ranged the spacy width and gone\nSwift north and south, striving to look upon\nAn ending somewhere. Many days I sped\nHard to the west, a thousand years I fled\nEastwards in fury, but I could not find\nThe fringes of the Infinite. Behind\nAnd yet behind, and ever at the end\nCame new beginnings, paths that did not wend\nTo anywhere were there: and ever vast\nAnd vaster spaces opened -- till at last\nDizzied with distance, thrilling to a pain\nUnnameable, I turned to Heaven again.\nAnd there My angels were prepared to fling\nThe cloudy incense, there prepared to sing\nMy praise and glory -- O, in fury I\nThen roared them senseless, then threw down the sky\nAnd stamped upon it, buffeted a star\nWith my great fist, and flung the sun afar:\nShouted My anger till the mighty sound\nRung to the width, frighting the furthest bound\nAnd scope of hearing: tumult vaster still,\nThroning the echo, dinned My ears, until\nI fled in silence, seeking out a place\nTo hide Me from the very thought of Space.\nAnd so, He thought, in Mine own Image I\nHave made a man, remote from Heaven high\nAnd all its humble angels: I have poured\nMy essence in his nostrils: I have cored\nHis heart with My own spirit; part of Me,\nHis mind with laboured growth unceasingly\nMust strive to equal Mine; must ever grow\nBy virtue of My essence till he know\nBoth good and evil through the solemn test\nOf sin and retribution, till, with zest,\nHe feels his godhead, soars to challenge Me\nIn Mine own Heaven for supremacy.\nThrough savage beasts and still more savage clay,\nInvincible, I bid him fight a way\nTo greater battles, crawling through defeat\nInto defeat again: ordained to meet\nDisaster in disaster; prone to fall,\nI prick him with My memory to call\nDefiance at his victor and arise\nWith anguished fury to his greater size\nThrough tribulation, terror, and despair.\nAstounded, he must fight to higher air,\nClimb battle into battle till he be\nConfronted with a flaming sword and Me.\nSo growing age by age to greater strength,\nTo greater beauty, skill and deep intent:\nWith wisdom wrung from pain, with energy\nNourished in sin and sorrow, he will be\nStrong, pure and proud an enemy to meet,\nTremendous on a battle-field, or sweet\nTo walk by as friend with candid mind.\n--Dear enemy or friend so hard to find,\nI yet shall find you, yet shall put My breast\nIn enmity or love against your breast:\nShall smite or clasp with equal ecstasy\nThe enemy or friend who grows to Me.\nThe topmost blossom of his growing I\nShall take unto Me, cherish and lift high\nBeside myself upon My holy throne: --\nIt is not good for God to be alone.\nThe perfect woman of his perfect race\nShall sit beside Me in the highest place\nAnd be my Goddess, Queen, Companion, Wife,\nThe rounder of My majesty, the life\nOf My ambition. She will smile to see\nMe bending down to worship at her knee\nWho never bent before, and she will say,\n'Dear God, who was it taught Thee how to pray?\"\nAnd through eternity, adown the slope\nOf never-ending time, compact of hope,\nOf zest and young enjoyment, I and She\nWill walk together, sowing jollity\nAmong the raving stars, and laughter through\nThe vacancies of Heaven, till the blue\nVast amplitudes of space lift up a song,\nThe echo of our presence, rolled along\nAnd ever rolling where the planets sing\nThe majesty and glory of the King.\nThen conquered, thou, Eternity, shalt lie\nUnder My hand as little as a fly.\nI am the Master: I the mighty God\nAnd you My workshop. Your pavilions trod\nBy Me and Mine shall never cease to be,\nFor you are but the magnitude of Me,\nThe width of My extension, the surround\nOf My dense splendour. Rolling, rolling round,\nTo steeped infinity, and out beyond\nMy own strong comprehension, you are bond\nAnd servile to My doings. Let you swing\nMore wide and ever wide, you do but fling\nAround the instant Me, and measure still\nThe breadth and proportion of My Will.\nThen stooping to the hut -- a beehive round --\nGod entered in and saw upon the ground\nThe dusty garland, Adam, (learned to weave)\nHad loving placed upon the head of Eve\nBefore the terror came, when joyous they\nCould look for God at closing of the day\nProfound and happy. So the Mighty Guest\nRent, took, and placed the blossoms in His breast.\n'This,' said He gently, 'I shall show My queen\nWhen she hath grown to Me in space serene,\nAnd say \"'twas worn by Eve.\"' So, smiling fair,\nHe spread abroad His wings upon the air.",

No longer creeps\nThe espalier by the stream,--the copse around?\nDoth not the wondrous arch of heaven still rise,\nNow rich in shape, now shapeless to the eyes?\nAs, seraph-like, from out the dark clouds' chorus,\nWith softness woven, graceful, light, and fair,\nResembling Her, in the blue aether o'er us,\nA slender figure hovers in the air,--\nThus didst thou see her joyously advance,\nThe fairest of the fairest in the dance.\nYet but a moment dost thou boldly dare\nTo clasp an airy form instead of hers;\nBack to thine heart! thou'lt find it better there,\nFor there in changeful guise her image stirs\nWhat erst was one, to many turneth fast,\nIn thousand forms, each dearer than the last.\nAs at the door, on meeting lingerd she,\nAnd step by step my faithful ardour bless'd,\nFor the last kiss herself entreated me,\nAnd on my lips the last last kiss impress'd,--\nThus clearly traced, the lov'd one's form we view,\nWith flames engraven on a heart so true,--\nA heart that, firm as some embattled tower,\nItself for her, her in itself reveres,\nFor her rejoices in its lasting power,\nConscious alone, when she herself appears;\nFeels itself freer in so sweet a thrall,\nAnd only beats to give her thanks in all.\nThe power of loving, and all yearning sighs\nFor love responsive were effaced and drown'd;\nWhile longing hope for joyous enterprise\nWas form'd, and rapid action straightway found;\nIf love can e'er a loving one inspire,\nMost lovingly it gave me now its fire;\nAnd 'twas through her!--an inward sorrow lay\nOn soul and body, heavily oppress'd;\nTo mournful phantoms was my sight a prey,\nIn the drear void of a sad tortured breast;\nNow on the well-known threshold Hope hath smil'd,\nHerself appeareth in the sunlight mild.\nUnto the peace of God, which, as we read,\nBlesseth us more than reason e'er bath done,\nLove's happy peace would I compare indeed,\nWhen in the presence of the dearest one.\nThere rests the heart, and there that sweetest thought,\nThe thought of being hers, is check'd by nought.\nIn the pure bosom doth a yearning float,\nUnto a holier, purer, unknown Being\nIts grateful aspiration to devote,\nThe Ever-Nameless then unriddled seeing;\nWe call it: piety!--such blest delight\nI feel a share in, when before her sight.\nBefore her sight, as 'neath the sun's hot ray,\nBefore her breath, as 'neath the spring's soft wind,\nIn its deep wintry cavern melts away\nSelf-love, so long in icy chains confin'd;\nNo selfishness and no self-will are nigh,\nFor at her advent they were forced to fly.\nIt seems as though she said: \"As hours pass by\nThey spread before us life with kindly plan;\nSmall knowledge did the yesterday supply,\nTo know the morrow is conceal'd from man;\nAnd if the thought of evening made me start,\nThe sun at setting gladden'd straight my heart.\n\"Act, then, as I, and look, with joyous mind,\nThe moment in the face; nor linger thou!\nMeet it with speed, so fraught with life, so kind\nIn action, and in love so radiant now;\nLet all things be where thou art, childlike ever,\nThus thoult be all, thus, thou'lt be vanquish'd never.\"\nThou speakest well, methought, for as thy guide\nThe moment's favour did a god assign,\nAnd each one feels himself when by thy side,\nFate's fav'rite in a moment so divine;\nI tremble at thy look that bids me go,\nWhy should I care such wisdom vast to know?\nNow am I far! And what would best befit\nThe present minute? I could scarcely tell;\nFull many a rich possession offers it,\nThese but offend, and I would fain repel.\nYearnings unquenchable still drive me on,\nAll counsel, save unbounded tears, is gone.\nFlow on, flow on in never-ceasing course,\nYet may ye never quench my inward fire!\nWithin my bosom heaves a mighty force,\nWhere death and life contend in combat dire.\nMedicines may serve the body's pangs to still;\nNought but the spirit fails in strength of will,--\nFails in conception; wherefore fails it so?\nA thousand times her image it portrays;\nEnchanting now, and now compell'd to go,\nNow indistinct, now clothed in purest rays!\nHow could the smallest comfort here be flowing?\nThe ebb and flood, the coming and the going!\nLeave me here now, my life's companions true!\nLeave me alone on rock, in moor and heath;\nBut courage! open lies the world to you,\nThe glorious heavens above, the earth beneath;\nObserve, investigate, with searching eyes,\nAnd nature will disclose her mysteries.\nTo me is all, I to myself am lost,\nWho the immortals' fav'rite erst was thought;\nThey, tempting, sent Pandoras to my cost,\nSo rich in wealth, with danger far more fraught;\nThey urged me to those lips, with rapture crown'd,\nDeserted me, and hurl'd me to the ground.",

Like clouds when winds are high,\nO'er glittering sands flew steeds of Araby,\nAnd tents rose up, and sudden lance and spear\nFlash'd where a fountain's diamond wave lay clear,\nShadow'd by graceful palm-trees. Then the shout\nOf merry England's joy swell'd freely out,\nSent thro' an eastern heaven, whose glorious hue\nMade shields dark mirrors to its depths of blue:\nAnd harps were there; I heard their sounding strings,\nAs the waste echoed to the mirth of kings.\nThe bright masque faded. Unto life's worn track,\nWhat call'd me from its flood of glory, back?\nA voice of happy childhood! and they pass'd,\nBanner, and harp, and Paynim's trumpet's blast;\nYet might I scarce bewail the splendours gone,\nMy heart so leap'd to that sweet laughter's tone.",

Such the sun, the moon,\nTrees old and young, sprouting a shady boon\nFor simple sheep; and such are daffodils\nWith the green world they live in; and clear rills\nThat for themselves a cooling covert make\n'Gainst the hot season; the mid forest brake,\nRich with a sprinkling of fair musk-rose blooms:\nAnd such too is the grandeur of the dooms\nWe have imagined for the mighty dead;\nAll lovely tales that we have heard or read:\nAn endless fountain of immortal drink,\nPouring unto us from the heaven's brink.\nNor do we merely feel these essences\nFor one short hour; no, even as the trees\nThat whisper round a temple become soon\nDear as the temple's self, so does the moon,\nThe passion poesy, glories infinite,\nHaunt us till they become a cheering light\nUnto our souls, and bound to us so fast,\nThat, whether there be shine, or gloom o'ercast;\nThey always must be with us, or we die.\nTherefore, 'tis with full happiness that I\nWill trace the story of Endymion.\nThe very music of the name has gone\nInto my being, and each pleasant scene\nIs growing fresh before me as the green\nOf our own valleys: so I will begin\nNow while I cannot hear the city's din;\nNow while the early budders are just new,\nAnd run in mazes of the youngest hue\nAbout old forests; while the willow trails\nIts delicate amber; and the dairy pails\nBring home increase of milk. And, as the year\nGrows lush in juicy stalks, I'll smoothly steer\nMy little boat, for many quiet hours,\nWith streams that deepen freshly into bowers.\nMany and many a verse I hope to write,\nBefore the daisies, vermeil rimm'd and white,\nHide in deep herbage; and ere yet the bees\nHum about globes of clover and sweet peas,\nI must be near the middle of my story.\nO may no wintry season, bare and hoary,\nSee it half finish'd: but let Autumn bold,\nWith universal tinge of sober gold,\nBe all about me when I make an end.\nAnd now, at once adventuresome, I send\nMy herald thought into a wilderness:\nThere let its trumpet blow, and quickly dress\nMy uncertain path with green, that I may speed\nEasily onward, thorough flowers and weed....",

Taken until the month of August.\nYou're in love - Your sonnets make Her laugh.\nAll your friends disappear, you are not quite the thing.\n- Then your adored one, one evening, condescends to write to you...!\nThat evening,... - you go back again to the dazzling cafes,\nYou ask for beer or for lemonade...\n- You are not really serious when you are seventeen\nAnd there are green lime trees on the promenade...\nOriginal French\nRoman\nI\nOn n'est pas sérieux, quand on a dix-sept ans.\n- Un beau soir, foin des bocks et de la limonade,\nDes cafés tapageurs aux lustres éclatants !\n- On va sous les tilleuls verts de la promenade.\nLes tilleuls sentent bon dans les bons soirs de juin !\nL'air est parfois si doux, qu'on ferme la paupière ;\nLe vent chargé de bruits - la ville n'est pas loin -\nA des parfums de vigne et des parfums de bière....\nII\n-Voilà qu'on aperçoit un tout petit chiffon\nD'azur sombre, encadré d'une petite branche,\nPiqué d'une mauvaise étoile, qui se fond\nAvec de doux frissons, petite et toute blanche...\nNuit de juin ! Dix-sept ans ! - On se laisse griser.\nLa sève est du champagne et vous monte à la tête...\nOn divague ; on se sent aux lèvres un baiser\nQui palpite là, comme une petite bête....\nIII\nLe coeur fou Robinsonne à travers les romans,\nLorsque, dans la clarté d'un pâle réverbère,\nPasse une demoiselle aux petits airs charmants,\nSous l'ombre du faux col effrayant de son père...\nEt, comme elle vous trouve immensément naïf,\nTout en faisant trotter ses petites bottines,\nElle se tourne, alerte et d'un mouvement vif....\n- Sur vos lèvres alors meurent les cavatines...\nIV\nVous êtes amoureux. Loué jusqu'au mois d'août.\nVous êtes amoureux. - Vos sonnets La font rire.\nTous vos amis s'en vont, vous êtes mauvais goût.\n- Puis l'adorée, un soir, a daigné vous écrire...!\n- Ce soir-là,... - vous rentrez aux cafés éclatants,\nVous demandez des bocks ou de la limonade..\n- On n'est pas sérieux, quand on a dix-sept ans\nEt qu'on a des tilleuls verts sur la promenade.",

        "text": "I'LL tell you a story ; but pass the 'jack',\nAnd let us make merry to-night, my men.\nAye, those were the days when my beard was black—\nI like to remember them now and then—\nThen Miles was living, and Cuthbert there,\nOn his lip was never a sign of down ;\nBut I carry about some braided hair,\nThat has not yet changed from the glossy brown\nThat it show'd the day when I broke the heart\nOf that bravest of destriers, 'Britomarte.'\nSir Hugh was slain (may his soul find grace !)\nIn the fray that was neither lost nor won\nAt Edgehill—then to St. Hubert's Chase\nLord Goring despatch'd a garrison—\nBut men and horses were ill to spare,\nAnd ere long the soldiers were shifted fast.\nAs for me, I never was quartered there\nTill Marston Moor had been lost ; at last,\nAs luck would have it, alone, and late\nIn the night, I rode to the northern gate.\nI thought, as I pass'd through the moonlit park,\nOn the boyish days I used to spend\nIn the halls of the knight lying stiff and stark—\nThought on his lady, my father's friend\n(Mine, too, in spite of my sinister bar,\nBut with that my story has naught to do)—\nShe died the winter before the war—\nDied giving birth to the baby Hugh.\nHe pass'd ere the green leaves clothed the bough,\nAnd the orphan girl was the heiress now.\nWhen I was a rude and a reckless boy,\nAnd she a brave and a beautiful child,\nI was her page, her playmate, her toy—\nI have crown'd her hair with the field-flowers wild\nCowslip and crowfoot and colt's-foot bright—\nI have carried her miles when the woods were wet,\nI have read her romances of dame and knight ;\nShe was my princess, my pride, my pet.\nThere was then this proverb us twain between,\nFor the glory of God and of Gwendoline.\nShe had grown to a maiden wonderful fair,\nBut for years I had scarcely seen her face.\nNow, with troopers Holdsworth, Huntly, and Clare,\nOld Miles kept guard at St. Hubert's Chase,\nAnd the chatelaine was a Mistress Ruth,\nSir Hugh's half-sister, an ancient dame,\nBut a mettlesome soul had she forsooth,\nAs she show'd when the time of her trial came.\nI bore despatches to Miles and to her\nTo warn them against the bands of Kerr.\nAnd mine would have been a perilous ride\nWith the rebel horsemen—we knew not where\nThey were scattered over that country side,—\nIf it had not been for my brave brown mare.\nShe was iron-sinew'd and satin-skinn'd,\nRibb'd like a drum and limb'd like a deer,\nFierce as the fire and fleet as the wind—\nThere was nothing she couldn't climb or clear—\nRich lords had vex'd me, in vain, to part\nFor their gold and silver, with Britomarte.\nNext morn we muster'd scarce half a score\nWith the serving men, who were poorly arm'd\nFive soldiers, counting myself, no more,\nAnd a culverin, which might well have harm'd\nUs, had we used it, but not our foes,\nWhen, with horses and foot, to our doors they came,\nAnd a psalm-singer summon'd us (through his nose),\nAnd deliver'd—'This, in the people's name,\nUnto whoso holdeth this fortress here,\nSurrender ! or bide the siege—John Kerr.'\n'Twas a mansion built in a style too new,\nA castle by courtesy, he lied\nWho called it a fortress—yet, 'tis true,\nIt had been indifferently fortified—\nWe were well provided with bolt and bar—\nAnd while I hurried to place our men,\nOld Miles was call'd to a council of war\nWith Mistress Ruth and with her, and when\nThey had argued loudly and long, those three,\nThey sent, as a last resource, for me.\nIn the chair of state sat erect Dame Ruth ;\nShe had cast aside her embroidery ;\nShe had been a beauty, they say, in her youth,\nThere was much fierce fire in her bold black eye.\n'Am I deceived in you both ?' quoth she.\n'If one spark of her father's spirit lives\nIn this girl here—so, this Leigh, Ralph Leigh,\nLet us hear what counsel the springald gives.'\nThen I stammer'd, somewhat taken aback—\n(Simon, you ale-swiller, pass the 'jack').\nThe dame wax'd hotter—'Speak out, lad, say,\nMust we fall in that canting caitiff's power ?\nShall we yield to a knave and a turncoat ? Nay,\nI had liever leap from our topmost tower.\nFor a while we can surely await relief ;\nOur walls are high and our doors are strong.'\nThis Kerr was indeed a canting thief—\nI know not rightly, some private wrong\nHe had done Sir Hugh, but I know this much,\nTraitor or turncoat he suffer'd as such.\nQuoth Miles—'Enough ! your will shall be done ;\nRelief may arrive by the merest chance,\nBut your house ere dusk will be lost and won ;\nThey have got three pieces of ordnance.'\nThen I cried, 'Lord Guy, with four troops of horse,\nEven now is biding at Westbrooke town ;\nIf a rider could break through the rebel force\nHe would bring relief ere the sun goes down\nThrough the postern door could I make one dart\nI could baffle them all upon Britomarte.'\nMiles mutter'd 'Madness !' Dame Ruth look'd grave,\nSaid, 'True, though we cannot keep one hour\nThe courtyard, no, nor the stables save,\nThey will have to batter piecemeal the tower,\nAnd thus——' But suddenly she halted there.\nWith a shining hand on my shoulder laid,\nStood Gwendoline.  She had left her chair,\nAnd, 'Nay, if it needs must be done,' she said,\n'Ralph Leigh will gladly do it, I ween,\nFor the glory of God and of Gwendoline.'\nI had undertaken a heavier task\nFor a lighter word.  I saddled with care,\nNor cumber'd myself with corselet nor casque\n(Being loth to burden the brave brown mare).\nYoung Clare kept watch on the wall—he cried,\n'Now, haste, Ralph ! this is the time to seize ;\nThe rebels are round us on every side,\nBut here they straggle by twos and threes.'\nThen out I led her, and up I sprung,\nAnd the postern door on its hinges swung.\nI had drawn this sword—you may draw it and feel,\nFor this is the blade that I bore that day—\nThere's a notch even now on the long grey steel,\nA nick that has never been rasp'd away.\nI bow'd my head and I buried my spurs,\nOne bound brought the gliding green beneath ;\nI could tell by her back-flung, flatten'd ears\nShe had fairly taken the bit in her teeth—\n(What, Jack, have you drain'd your namesake dry,\nLeft nothing to quench the thirst of a fly ?)\nThese things are done, and are done with, lad,\nIn far less time than your talker tells;\nThe sward with their hoof-strokes shook like mad,\nAnd rang with their carbines and petronels ;\nAnd they shouted, 'Cross him and cut him off,'\n'Surround him,' 'Seize him,' 'Capture the clown,\nOr kill him,' 'Shall he escape to scoff\nIn your faces ?' 'Shoot him or cut him down.'\nAnd their bullets whistled on every side :\nMany were near us and more were wide.\nNot a bullet told upon Britomarte ;\nSuddenly snorting, she launched along ;\nSo the osprey dives where the seagulls dart,\nSo the falcon swoops where the kestrels throng ;\nAnd full in my front one pistol flash'd,\nAnd right in my path their sergeant got.\nHow are jack-boots jarr'd, how are stirrups clash'd,\nWhile the mare like a meteor past him shot ;\nBut I clove his skull with a backstroke clean,\nFor the glory of God and of Gwendoline.\nAnd as one whom the fierce wind storms in the face\nWith spikes of hail and with splinters of rain,\nI, while we fled through St. Hubert's Chase,\nBent till my cheek was amongst her mane.\nTo the north full a league of the deer-park lay,\nSmooth, springy turf, and she fairly flew,\nAnd the sound of their hoof-strokes died away,\nAnd their far shots faint in the distance grew.\nLoudly I laughed, having won the start,\nAt the folly of following Britomarte.\nThey had posted a guard at the northern gate—\nSome dozen of pikemen and musketeers.\nTo the tall park palings I turn'd her straight ;\nShe veer'd in her flight as the swallow veers.\nAnd some blew matches and some drew swords,\nAnd one of them wildly hurl'd his pike,\nBut she clear'd by inches the oaken boards,\nAnd she carried me yards beyond the dyke ;\nThen gaily over the long green down\nWe gallop'd, heading for Westbrooke town.\nThe green down slopes to the great grey moor,\nThe grey moor sinks to the gleaming Skelt—\nSudden and sullen, and swift and sure,\nThe whirling water was round my belt.\nShe breasted the bank with a savage snort,\nAnd a backward glance of her bloodshot eye,\nAnd 'Our Lady of Andover's' flash'd like thought,\nAnd flitted St. Agatha's nunnery,\nAnd the firs at The Ferngrove fled on the right,\nAnd 'Falconer's Tower' on the left took flight.\nAnd over 'The Ravenswold' we raced—\nWe rounded the hill by 'The Hermit's Well'—\nWe burst on the Westbrooke Bridge—'What haste ?\nWhat errand ?' shouted the sentinel.\n'To Beelzebub with the Brewer's knave !'\n'Carolus Rex and he of the Rhine !'\nGalloping past him, I got and gave\nIn the gallop password and countersign,\nAll soak'd with water and soil'd with mud,\nWith the sleeve of my jerkin half drench'd in blood.\nNow, Heaven be praised that I found him there—\nLord Guy.  He said, having heard my tale,\n'Leigh, let my own man look to your mare,\nRest and recruit with our wine and ale ;\nBut first must our surgeon attend to you ;\nYou are somewhat shrewdly stricken, no doubt.'\nThen he snatched a horn from the wall and blew,\nMaking 'Boot and Saddle' ring sharply out.\n'Have I done good service this day ?' quoth I.\n'Then I will ride back in your troop, Lord Guy.'\nIn the street I heard how the trumpets peal'd,\nAnd I caught the gleam of a morion\nFrom the window—then to the door I reel'd ;\nI had lost more blood than I reckon'd upon ;\nHe eyed me calmly with keen grey eyes—\nStern grey eyes of a steel-blue grey—\nSaid, 'The wilful man can never be wise,\nNathless the wilful must have his way,'\nAnd he pour'd from a flagon some fiery wine ;\nI drain'd it, and straightway strength was mine.\n.   .   .   .   .   .   .\nI was with them all the way on the brown—\n'Guy to the rescue !'  'God and the king !'\nWe were just in time, for the doors were down ;\nAnd didn't our sword-blades rasp and ring,\nAnd didn't we hew and didn't we hack ?\nThe sport scarce lasted minutes ten—\n(Aye, those were the days when my beard was black ;\nI like to remember them now and then).\nThough they fought like fiends, we were four to one,\nAnd we captured those that refused to run.\nWe have not forgotten it, Cuthbert, boy !\nThat supper scene when the lamps were lit ;\nHow the women (some of them) sobb'd for joy ;\nHow the soldiers drank the deeper for it;\nHow the dame did honours, and Gwendoline,\nHow grandly she glided into the hall,\nHow she stoop'd with the grace of a girlish queen,\nAnd kiss'd me gravely before them all ;\nAnd the stern Lord Guy, how gaily he laugh'd,\nTill more of his cup was spilt than quaff'd.\nBrown Britomarte lay dead in her straw\nNext morn—we buried her—brave old girl !\nJohn Kerr, we tried him by martial law,\nAnd we twisted some hemp for the trait'rous churl ;\nAnd she—I met her alone—said she,\n'You have risk'd your life, you have lost your mare,\nAnd what can I give in return, Ralph Leigh ?'\nI replied, 'One braid of that bright brown hair.'\nAnd with that she bow'd her beautiful head,\n'You can take as much as you choose,' she said.\nAnd I took it—it may be, more than enough—\nAnd I shore it rudely, close to the roots.\nThe wine or wounds may have made me rough,\nAnd men at the bottom are merely brutes.\nThree weeks I slept at St. Hubert's Chase ;\nWhen I woke from the fever of wounds and wine\nI could scarce believe that the ghastly face\nThat the glass reflected was really mine.\nI sought the hall—where a wedding had been—\nThe wedding of Guy and of Gwendoline.\nThe romance of a grizzled old trooper's life\nMay make you laugh in your sleeves : laugh out,\nLads ; we have most of us seen some strife ;\nWe have all of us had some sport, no doubt.\nI have won some honour and gain'd some gold,\nNow that our king returns to his own ;\nIf the pulses beat slow, if the blood runs cold,\nAnd if friends have faded and loves have flown,\nThen the greater reason is ours to drink,\nAnd the more we swallow the less we shall think.\nAt the battle of Naseby, Miles was slain,\nAnd Huntly sank from his wounds that week ;\nWe left young Clare upon Worcester plain—\nHow the 'Ironside' gash'd his girlish cheek.\nAye, strut, and swagger, and ruffle anew,\nGay gallants, now that the war is done !\nThey fought like fiends (give the fiend his due)—\nWe fought like fops, it was thus they won.\nHoldsworth is living for aught I know,\nAt least he was living two years ago,\nAnd Guy—Lord Guy—so stately and stern,\nHe is changed, I met him at Winchester ;\nHe has grown quite gloomy and taciturn.\nGwendoline !—why do you ask for her ?\nDied ! as her mother had died before—\nDied giving birth to the baby Guy !\nDid my voice shake ? Then am I fool the more.\nSooner or later we all must die ;\nBut, at least, let us live while we live to-night.\nThe days may be dark, but the lamps are bright.\nFor to me the sunlight seems worn and wan :\nThe sun, he is losing his splendour now—\nHe can never shine as of old he shone\nOn her glorious hair and glittering brow.\nAh ! those days that were, when my beard was black,\nNow I have only the nights that are.\nWhat, landlord, ho ! bring in haste burnt sack,\nAnd a flask of your fiercest usquebaugh.\nYou, Cuthbert ! surely you know by heart\nThe story of her and of Britomarte.",

The gulls flew over,\nDropping, crying alone; thin ragged lengths of cloud\nDrifted in bars across the sun. There on the shore\nThe crowd's response was instantaneous. He\nHandled it well, I thought--the gait, the tilt of the head, just right.\nLong streaks of light were blinding on the waves.\nAnd then we knew our work well worth the time:\nThe days of sawing, fitting, all those nails,\nThe tiresome rehearsals, considerations of execution.\nBut if you want a miracle, you have to work for it,\nLay your plans carefully and keep one jump\nAhead of the crowd. To report a miracle\nIs a pleasure unalloyed; but staging one requires\nTact, imagination, a special knack for the job\nNot everyone possesses. A miracle, in fact, means work.\n--And now there are those who have come saying\nThat miracles were not what we were after. But what else\nIs there? What other hope does life hold out\nBut the miraculous, the skilled and patient\nExecution, the teamwork, all the pain and worry every miracle involves?\nVisionaries tossing in their beds, haunted and racked\nBy questions of Messiahship and eschatology,\nAre like the mist rising at nightfall, and come,\nPerhaps to even less. Grave supernaturalists, devoted worshippers\nExperience the ecstasy (such as it is), but not\nOur ecstasy. It was our making. Yet sometimes\nWhen the torrent of that time\nComes pouring back, I wonder at our courage\nAnd our enterprise. It was as though the world\nHad been one darkening, abandoned hall\nWhere rows of unlit candles stood; and we\nNot out of love, so much, or hope, or even worship, but\nOut of the fear of death, came with our lights\nAnd watched the candles, one by one, take fire, flames\nAgainst the long night of our fear. We thought\nThat we could never die. Now I am less convinced.\n--The traveller on the plain makes out the mountains\nAt a distance; then he loses sight. His way\nWinds through the valleys; then, at a sudden turning of a path,\nThe peaks stand nakedly before him: they are something else\nThan what he saw below.

I am dying!\nPoor fellow we kept his body thinking the rest of us would be saved,\nThen, with hunger, Angus McDonald began to cry and madly raved.\nAnd he cried, Oh, God! send us some kind of meat,\nBecause I'm resolved to have something to eat;\nOh! do not let us starve on the briny flood\nOr else I will drink of poor Jim's blood.\nThen he suddenly seized his knife and cut off poor Jim's arm,\nNot thinking in his madness he'd done any harm;\nThen poor Jim's blood he did drink and his flesh did eat,\nDeclaring that the blood tasted like cream, and was a treat.\nThen he asked me to taste it, saying It was good without doubt,\nThen I tasted it, but in disgust I instantly spat it out;\nSaying, if I was to die within an hour on the briny flood,\nI would neither eat the flesh nor drink the blood.\nThen in the afternoon again he turned to me,\nSaying, I'm going to cut Jim's throat for more blood d'ye see;\nThen I begged of him, for God's sake not to cut the throat of poor Jim,\nBut he cried, Ha! ha! to save my own life I consider it no sin.\nI tried to prevent him but he struck me without dismay\nAnd cut poor Jim's throat in defiance of me, or all I could say,\nAlso a piece of flesh from each thigh, and began to eat away,\nBut poor fellow he sickened about noon, and died on the Sunday.\nNow it is all over and I will thank all my life,\nWho has preserved me and my mate, McEachern, in the midst of danger and strife;\nAnd I hope that all landsmen of low and high degree,\nWill think of the hardships of poor mariners while at sea.",

The gentle-hearted wife\nSat shuddering at the ruin of a world;\nHe at his own: but when the wordy storm\nHad ended, forth they came and paced the shore,\nRan in and out the long sea-framing caves,\nDrank the large air, and saw, but scarce believed\n(The sootflake of so many a summer still\nClung to their fancies)  that they saw, the sea.\nSo now on sand they walk'd, and now on cliff,\nLingering about the thymy promontories,\nTill all the sails were darken'd in the west,\nAnd rosed in the east: then homeward and to bed:\nWhere she, who kept a tender Christian hope\nHaunting a holy text, and still to that\nReturning, as the bird returns, at night,\n`Let not the sun go down upon your wrath,'\nSaid, `Love, forgive him:' but he did not speak;\nAnd silenced by that silence lay the wife,\nRemembering her dear Lord who died for all,\nAnd musing on the little lives of men,\nAnd how they mar this little by their feuds.\nBut while the two were sleeping, a full tide\nRose with ground-swell, which, on the foremost rocks\nTouching, upjetted in spirts of wild sea-smoke,\nAnd scaled in sheets of wasteful foam, and fell\nIn vast sea-cataracts- ever and anon\nDead claps of thunder from within the cliffs\nHeard thro' the living roar.  At this the babe,\nTheir Margaret cradled near them, wail'd and woke\nThe mother, and the father suddenly cried,\n`A wreck, a wreck! ' then turn'd, and groaning said,\n`Forgive!  How many will say, 'forgive,' and find\nA sort of absolution in the sound\nTo hate a little longer!  No; the sin\nThat neither God nor man can well forgive,\nHypocrisy, I saw it in him at once.\nIs it so true that second thoughts are best?\nNot first, and third, which are a riper first?\nToo ripe, too late! they come too late for use.\nAh love, there surely lives in man and beast\nSomething divine to warn them of their foes:\nAnd such a sense, when first I fronted him,\nSaid, 'trust him not; ' but after, when I came\nTo know him more, I lost it, knew him less;\nFought with what seem'd my own uncharity;\nSat at his table; drank his costly wines;\nMade more and more allowance for his talk;\nWent further, fool! and trusted him with all,\nAll my poor scrapings from a dozen years\nOf dust and deskwork: there is no such mine,\nNone; but a gulf of ruin, swallowing gold,\nNot making.  Ruin'd! ruin'd! the sea roars\nRuin: a fearful night! '\n`Not fearful; fair,'\nSaid the good wife, `if every star in heaven\nCan make it fair: you do but bear the tide.\nHad you ill dreams? '\n`O yes,' he said, `I dream'd\nOf such a tide swelling toward the land,\nAnd I from out the boundless outer deep\nSwept with it to the shore, and enter'd one\nOf those dark caves that run beneath the cliffs.\nI thought the motion of the boundless deep\nBore through the cave, and I was heaved upon it\nIn darkness: then I saw one lovely star\nLarger and larger.  'What a world,' I thought,\n'To live in! ' but in moving I found\nOnly the landward exit of the cave,\nBright with the sun upon the stream beyond:\nAnd near the light a giant woman sat,\nAll over earthy, like a piece of earth,\nA pickaxe in her hand: then out I slipt\nInto a land all of sun and blossom, trees\nAs high as heaven, and every bird that sings:\nAnd here the night-light flickering in my eyes\nAwoke me.'\n`That was then your dream,' she said,\n`Not sad, but sweet.'\n`So sweet, I lay,' said he,\n`And mused upon it, drifting up the stream\nIn fancy, till I slept again, and pieced\nThe broken vision; for I dream'd that still\nThe motion of the great deep bore me on,\nAnd that the woman walk'd upon the brink:\nI wonder'd at her strength, and ask'd her of it:\n'It came,' she said, 'by working in the mines:'\nO then to ask her of my shares, I thought;\nAnd ask'd; but not a word; she shook her head.\nAnd then the motion of the current ceased,\nAnd there was rolling thunder; and we reach'd\nA mountain, like a wall of burs and thorns;\nBut she with her strong feet up the steep hill\nTrod out a path: I follow'd; and at top\nShe pointed seaward: there a fleet of glass,\nThat seem'd a fleet of jewels under me,\nSailing along before a gloomy cloud\nThat not one moment ceased to thunder, past\nIn sunshine: right across its track there lay,\nDown in the water, a long reef of gold,\nOr what seem'd gold: and I was glad at first\nTo think that in our often-ransack'd world\nStill so much gold was left; and then I fear'd\nLest the gay navy there should splinter on it,\nAnd fearing waved my arm to warn them off;\nAn idle signal, for the brittle fleet\n(I thought I could have died to save it)  near'd,\nTouch'd, clink'd, and clash'd, and vanish'd, and I woke,\nI heard the clash so clearly.  Now I see\nMy dream was Life; the woman honest Work;\nAnd my poor venture but a fleet of glass\nWreck'd on a reef of visionary gold.'\n`Nay,' said the kindly wife to comfort him,\n`You raised your arm, you tumbled down and broke\nThe glass with little Margaret's medicine it it;\nAnd, breaking that, you made and broke your dream:\nA trifle makes a dream, a trifle breaks.'\n`No trifle,' groan'd the husband; `yesterday\nI met him suddenly in the street, and ask'd\nThat which I ask'd the woman in my dream.\nLike her, he shook his head.  'Show me the books! '\nHe dodged me with a long and loose account.\n'The books, the books! ' but he, he could not wait,\nBound on a matter he of life and death:\nWhen the great Books (see Daniel seven and ten)\nWere open'd, I should find he meant me well;\nAnd then began to bloat himself, and ooze\nAll over with the fat affectionate smile\nThat makes the widow lean.  'My dearest friend,\nHave faith, have faith!  We live by faith,' said he;\n'And all things work together for the good\nOf those'- it makes me sick to quote him- last\nGript my hand hard, and with God-bless-you went.\nI stood like one that had received a blow:\nI found a hard friend in his loose accounts,\nA loose one in the hard grip of his hand,\nA curse in his God-bless-you: then my eyes\nPursued him down the street, and far away,\nAmong the honest shoulders of the crowd,\nRead rascal in the motions of his back,\nAnd scoundrel in the supple-sliding knee.'\n`Was he so bound, poor soul? ' said the good wife;\n`So are we all: but do not call him, love,\nBefore you prove him, rogue, and proved, forgive.\nHis gain is loss; for he that wrongs his friend\nWrongs himself more, and ever bears about\nA silent court of justice in his breast,\nHimself the judge and jury, and himself\nThe prisoner at the bar, ever condemn'd:\nAnd that drags down his life: then comes what comes\nHereafter: and he meant, he said he meant,\nPerhaps he meant, or partly meant, you well.'\n` 'With all his conscience and one eye askew'-\nLove, let me quote these lines, that you may learn\nA man is likewise counsel for himself,\nToo often, in that silent court of yours-\n'With all his conscience and one eye askew,\nSo false, he partly took himself for true;\nWhose pious talk, when most his heart was dry,\nMade wet the crafty crowsfoot round his eye;\nWho, never naming God except for gain,\nSo never took that useful name in vain;\nMade Him his catspaw and the Cross his tool,\nAnd Christ the bait to trap his dupe and fool;\nNor deeds of gift, but gifts of grace he forged,\nAnd snakelike slimed his victim ere he gorged;\nAnd oft at Bible meetings, o'er the rest\nArising, did his holy oily best,\nDropping the too rough H in Hell and Heaven,\nTo spread the Word by which himself had thriven.'\nHow like you this old satire? '\n`Nay,' she said\n`I loathe it: he had never kindly heart,\nNor ever cared to better his own kind,\nWho first wrote satire, with no pity in it.\nBut will you hear MY dream, for I had one\nThat altogether went to music?  Still\nIt awed me.'\nThen she told it, having dream'd\nOf that same coast.\n- But round the North, a light,\nA belt, it seem'd, of luminous vapor, lay,\nAnd ever in it a low musical note\nSwell'd up and died; and, as it swell'd, a ridge\nOf breaker issued from the belt, and still\nGrew with the growing note, and when the note\nHad reach'd a thunderous fullness, on those cliffs\nBroke, mixt with awful light (the same as that\nLiving within the belt)  whereby she saw\nThat all those lines of cliffs were cliffs no more,\nBut huge cathedral fronts of every age,\nGrave, florid, stern, as far as eye could see.\nOne after one: and then the great ridge drew,\nLessening to the lessening music, back,\nAnd past into the belt and swell'd again\nSlowly to music: ever when it broke\nThe statues, king or saint, or founder fell;\nThen from the gaps and chasms of ruin left\nCame men and women in dark clusters round,\nSome crying, 'Set them up! they shall not fall! '\nAnd others 'Let them lie, for they have fall'n.'\nAnd still they strove and wrangled: and she grieved\nIn her strange dream, she knew not why, to find\nTheir wildest wailings never out of tune\nWith that sweet note; and ever as their shrieks\nRan highest up the gamut, that great wave\nReturning, while none mark'd it, on the crowd\nBroke, mixt with awful light, and show'd their eyes\nGlaring, and passionate looks, and swept away\nThe men of flesh and blood, and men of stone,\nTo the waste deeps together.\n`Then I fixt\nMy wistful eyes on two fair images,\nBoth crown'd with stars and high among the stars,-\nThe Virgin Mother standing with her child\nHigh up on one of those dark minster-fronts-\nTill she began to totter, and the child\nClung to the mother, and sent out a cry\nWhich mixt with little Margaret's, and I woke,\nAnd my dream awed me:- well- but what are dreams?\nYours came but from the breaking of a glass,\nAnd mine but from the crying of a child.'\n`Child?  No! ' said he, `but this tide's roar, and his,\nOur Boanerges with his threats of doom,\nAnd loud-lung'd Antibabylonianisms\n(Altho' I grant but little music there)\nWent both to make your dream: but if there were\nA music harmonizing our wild cries,\nSphere-music such as that you dream'd about,\nWhy, that would make our passions far too like\nThe discords dear to the musician.  No-\nOne shriek of hate would jar all the hymns of heaven:\nTrue Devils with no ear, they howl in tune\nWith nothing but the Devil! '\n`'True' indeed!\nOne of our town, but later by an hour\nHere than ourselves, spoke with me on the shore;\nWhile you were running down the sands, and made\nThe dimpled flounce of the sea-furbelow flap,\nGood man, to please the child.  She brought strange news.\nWhy were you silent when I spoke to-night?\nI had set my heart on your forgiving him\nBefore you knew.  We MUST forgive the dead.'\n`Dead! who is dead? '\n`The man your eye pursued.\nA little after you had parted with him,\nHe suddenly dropt dead of heart-disease.'\n`Dead? he? of heart-disease? what heart had he\nTo die of? dead! '\n`Ah, dearest, if there be\nA devil in man, there is an angel too,\nAnd if he did that wrong you charge him with,\nHis angel broke his heart.  But your rough voice\n(You spoke so loud)  has roused the child again.\nSleep, little birdie, sleep! will she not sleep\nWithout her 'little birdie? ' well then, sleep,\nAnd I will sing you 'birdie.''\nSaying this,\nThe woman half turn'd round from him she loved,\nLeft him one hand, and reaching thro' the night\nHer other, found (for it was close beside)\nAnd half embraced the basket cradle-head\nWith one soft arm, which, like the pliant bough\nThat moving moves the nest and nestling, sway'd\nThe cradle, while she sang this baby song.\nWhat does the little birdie say\nIn her nest at peep of day?\nLet me fly, says little birdie,\nMother, let me fly away.\nBirdie, rest a little longer,\nTill the little wings are stronger.\nSo she rests a little longer,\nThen she flies away.\nWhat does little baby say,\nIn her bed at peep of day?\nBaby says, like little birdie,\nLet me rise and fly away.\nBaby, sleep a little longer,\nTill the little limbs are stronger.\nIf she sleeps a little longer,\nBaby too shall fly away.\n`She sleeps: let us too, let all evil, sleep.\nHe also sleeps- another sleep than ours.\nHe can do no more wrong: forgive him, dear,\nAnd I shall sleep the sounder! '\nThen the man,\n`His deeds yet live, the worst is yet to come.\nYet let your sleep for this one night be sound:\nI do forgive him! '\n`Thanks, my love,' she said,\n`Your own will be the sweeter,' and they slept.",

        "text": "Between me and the sunset, like a dome\nAgainst the glory of a world on fire,\nNow burned a sudden hill,\nBleak, round, and high, by flame-lit height made higher,\nWith nothing on it for the flame to kill\nSave one who moved and was alone up there\nTo loom before the chaos and the glare\nAs if he were the last god going home\nUnto his last desire.\nDark, marvelous, and inscrutable he moved on\nTill down the fiery distance he was gone,\nLike one of those eternal, remote things\nThat range across a man’s imaginings\nWhen a sure music fills him and he knows\nWhat he may say thereafter to few men,—\nThe touch of ages having wrought\nAn echo and a glimpse of what he thought\nA phantom or a legend until then;\nFor whether lighted over ways that save,\nOr lured from all repose,\nIf he go on too far to find a grave,\nMostly alone he goes.\nEven he, who stood where I had found him,\nOn high with fire all round him,\nWho moved along the molten west,\nAnd over the round hill’s crest\nThat seemed half ready with him to go down,\nFlame-bitten and flame-cleft,\nAs if there were to be no last thing left\nOf a nameless unimaginable town,—\nEven he who climbed and vanished may have taken\nDown to the perils of a depth not known,\nFrom death defended though by men forsaken,\nThe bread that every man must eat alone;\nHe may have walked while others hardly dared\nLook on to see him stand where many fell;\nAnd upward out of that, as out of hell,\nHe may have sung and striven\nTo mount where more of him shall yet be given,\nBereft of all retreat,\nTo sevenfold heat,—\nAs on a day when three in Dura shared\nThe furnace, and were spared\nFor glory by that king of Babylon\nWho made himself so great that God, who heard,\nCovered him with long feathers, like a bird.\nAgain, he may have gone down easily,\nBy comfortable altitudes, and found,\nAs always, underneath him solid ground\nWhereon to be sufficient and to stand\nPossessed already of the promised land,\nFar stretched and fair to see:\nA good sight, verily,\nAnd one to make the eyes of her who bore him\nShine glad with hidden tears.\nWhy question of his ease of who before him,\nIn one place or another where they left\nTheir names as far behind them as their bones,\nAnd yet by dint of slaughter toil and theft,\nAnd shrewdly sharpened stones,\nCarved hard the way for his ascendency\nThrough deserts of lost years?\nWhy trouble him now who sees and hears\nNo more than what his innocence requires,\nAnd therefore to no other height aspires\nThan one at which he neither quails nor tires?\nHe may do more by seeing what he sees\nThan others eager for iniquities;\nHe may, by seeing all things for the best,\nIncite futurity to do the rest.\nOr with an even likelihood,\nHe may have met with atrabilious eyes\nThe fires of time on equal terms and passed\nIndifferently down, until at last\nHis only kind of grandeur would have been,\nApparently, in being seen.\nHe may have had for evil or for good\nNo argument; he may have had no care\nFor what without himself went anywhere\nTo failure or to glory, and least of all\nFor such a stale, flamboyant miracle;\nHe may have been the prophet of an art\nImmovable to old idolatries;\nHe may have been a player without a part,\nAnnoyed that even the sun should have the skies\nFor such a flaming way to advertise;\nHe may have been a painter sick at heart\nWith Nature’s toiling for a new surprise;\nHe may have been a cynic, who now, for all\nOf anything divine that his effete\nNegation may have tasted,\nSaw truth in his own image, rather small,\nForbore to fever the ephemeral,\nFound any barren height a good retreat\nFrom any swarming street,\nAnd in the sun saw power superbly wasted;\nAnd when the primitive old-fashioned stars\nCame out again to shine on joys and wars\nMore primitive, and all arrayed for doom,\nHe may have proved a world a sorry thing\nIn his imagining,\nAnd life a lighted highway to the tomb.\nOr, mounting with infirm unsearching tread,\nHis hopes to chaos led,\nHe may have stumbled up there from the past,\nAnd with an aching strangeness viewed the last\nAbysmal conflagration of his dreams,—\nA flame where nothing seems\nTo burn but flame itself, by nothing fed;\nAnd while it all went out,\nNot even the faint anodyne of doubt\nMay then have eased a painful going down\nFrom pictured heights of power and lost renown,\nRevealed at length to his outlived endeavor\nRemote and unapproachable forever;\nAnd at his heart there may have gnawed\nSick memories of a dead faith foiled and flawed\nAnd long dishonored by the living death\nAssigned alike by chance\nTo brutes and hierophants;\nAnd anguish fallen on those he loved around him\nMay once have dealt the last blow to confound him,\nAnd so have left him as death leaves a child,\nWho sees it all too near;\nAnd he who knows no young way to forget\nMay struggle to the tomb unreconciled.\nWhatever suns may rise or set\nThere may be nothing kinder for him here\nThan shafts and agonies;\nAnd under these\nHe may cry out and stay on horribly;\nOr, seeing in death too small a thing to fear,\nHe may go forward like a stoic Roman\nWhere pangs and terrors in his pathway lie,—\nOr, seizing the swift logic of a woman,\nCurse God and die.\nOr maybe there, like many another one\nWho might have stood aloft and looked ahead,\nBlack-drawn against wild red,\nHe may have built, unawed by fiery gules\nThat in him no commotion stirred,\nA living reason out of molecules\nWhy molecules occurred,\nAnd one for smiling when he might have sighed\nHad he seen far enough,\nAnd in the same inevitable stuff\nDiscovered an odd reason too for pride\nIn being what he must have been by laws\nInfrangible and for no kind of cause.\nDeterred by no confusion or surprise\nHe may have seen with his mechanic eyes\nA world without a meaning, and had room,\nAlone amid magnificence and doom,\nTo build himself an airy monument\nThat should, or fail him in his vague intent,\nOutlast an accidental universe—\nTo call it nothing worse—\nOr, by the burrowing guile\nOf Time disintegrated and effaced,\nLike once-remembered mighty trees go down\nTo ruin, of which by man may now be traced\nNo part sufficient even to be rotten,\nAnd in the book of things that are forgotten\nIs entered as a thing not quite worth while.\nHe may have been so great\nThat satraps would have shivered at his frown,\nAnd all he prized alive may rule a state\nNo larger than a grave that holds a clown;\nHe may have been a master of his fate,\nAnd of his atoms,—ready as another\nIn his emergence to exonerate\nHis father and his mother;\nHe may have been a captain of a host,\nSelf-eloquent and ripe for prodigies,\nDoomed here to swell by dangerous degrees,\nAnd then give up the ghost.\nNahum’s great grasshoppers were such as these,\nSun-scattered and soon lost.\nWhatever the dark road he may have taken,\nThis man who stood on high\nAnd faced alone the sky,\nWhatever drove or lured or guided him,—\nA vision answering a faith unshaken,\nAn easy trust assumed of easy trials,\nA sick negation born of weak denials,\nA crazed abhorrence of an old condition,\nA blind attendance on a brief ambition,—\nWhatever stayed him or derided him,\nHis way was even as ours;\nAnd we, with all our wounds and all our powers,\nMust each await alone at his own height\nAnother darkness or another light;\nAnd there, of our poor self dominion reft,\nIf inference and reason shun\nHell, Heaven, and Oblivion,\nMay thwarted will (perforce precarious,\nBut for our conservation better thus)\nHave no misgiving left\nOf doing yet what here we leave undone?\nOr if unto the last of these we cleave,\nBelieving or protesting we believe\nIn such an idle and ephemeral\nFlorescence of the diabolical,—\nIf, robbed of two fond old enormities,\nOur being had no onward auguries,\nWhat then were this great love of ours to say\nFor launching other lives to voyage again\nA little farther into time and pain,\nA little faster in a futile chase\nFor a kingdom and a power and a Race\nThat would have still in sight\nA manifest end of ashes and eternal night?\nIs this the music of the toys we shake\nSo loud,—as if there might be no mistake\nSomewhere in our indomitable will?\nAre we no greater than the noise we make\nAlong one blind atomic pilgrimage\nWhereon by crass chance billeted we go\nBecause our brains and bones and cartilage\nWill have it so?\nIf this we say, then let us all be still\nAbout our share in it, and live and die\nMore quietly thereby.\nWhere was he going, this man against the sky?\nYou know not, nor do I.\nBut this we know, if we know anything:\nThat we may laugh and fight and sing\nAnd of our transience here make offering\nTo an orient Word that will not be erased,\nOr, save in incommunicable gleams\nToo permanent for dreams,\nBe found or known.\nNo tonic and ambitious irritant\nOf increase or of want\nHas made an otherwise insensate waste\nOf ages overthrown\nA ruthless, veiled, implacable foretaste\nOf other ages that are still to be\nDepleted and rewarded variously\nBecause a few, by fate’s economy,\nShall seem to move the world the way it goes;\nNo soft evangel of equality,\nSafe-cradled in a communal repose\nThat huddles into death and may at last\nBe covered well with equatorial snows—\nAnd all for what, the devil only knows—\nWill aggregate an inkling to confirm\nThe credit of a sage or of a worm,\nOr tell us why one man in five\nShould have a care to stay alive\nWhile in his heart he feels no violence\nLaid on his humor and intelligence\nWhen infant Science makes a pleasant face\nAnd waves again that hollow toy, the Race;\nNo planetary trap where souls are wrought\nFor nothing but the sake of being caught\nAnd sent again to nothing will attune\nItself to any key of any reason\nWhy man should hunger through another season\nTo find out why ’twere better late than soon\nTo go away and let the sun and moon\nAnd all the silly stars illuminate\nA place for creeping things,\nAnd those that root and trumpet and have wings,\nAnd herd and ruminate,\nOr dive and flash and poise in rivers and seas,\nOr by their loyal tails in lofty trees\nHang screeching lewd victorious derision\nOf man’s immortal vision.\nShall we, because Eternity records\nToo vast an answer for the time-born words\nWe spell, whereof so many are dead that once\nIn our capricious lexicons\nWere so alive and final, hear no more\nThe Word itself, the living word\nThat none alive has ever heard\nOr ever spelt,\nAnd few have ever felt\nWithout the fears and old surrenderings\nAnd terrors that began\nWhen Death let fall a feather from his wings\nAnd humbled the first man?\nBecause the weight of our humility,\nWherefrom we gain\nA little wisdom and much pain,\nFalls here too sore and there too tedious,\nAre we in anguish or complacency,\nNot looking far enough ahead\nTo see by what mad couriers we are led\nAlong the roads of the ridiculous,\nTo pity ourselves and laugh at faith\nAnd while we curse life bear it?\nAnd if we see the soul’s dead end in death,\nAre we to fear it?\nWhat folly is here that has not yet a name\nUnless we say outright that we are liars?\nWhat have we seen beyond our sunset fires\nThat lights again the way by which we came?\nWhy pay we such a price, and one we give\nSo clamoringly, for each racked empty day\nThat leads one more last human hope away,\nAs quiet fiends would lead past our crazed eyes\nOur children to an unseen sacrifice?\nIf after all that we have lived and thought,\nAll comes to Nought,—\nIf there be nothing after Now,\nAnd we be nothing anyhow,\nAnd we know that,—why live?\n’Twere sure but weaklings’ vain distress\nTo suffer dungeons where so many doors\nWill open on the cold eternal shores\nThat look sheer down\nTo the dark tideless floods of Nothingness\nWhere all who know may drown.",

It were a kind\nOf immortality\nTo spend with them one holy hour,\nAnd know their love and grasp their power.\nAnd wrapt around with glad content,\nI learn with soul serene,\nCaught from the beauty that is blent\nIn earth, the heaven's luminous tent,\nThe frost-lit dreams between,\nAnd something holier out of sight,\nGlad visions of the infinite.\nThen backward past the sere hill's breast,\nThe spectral moaning wood,\nWith great peace brooding in my breast,\nI turn me toward the common rest\nOf earth's worn brotherhood;\nBut as I pass, a sacred sign,\nEach lays his holy lips on mine:--\nGives me the golden chrism of song,\nTips my hushed heart with fire;\nTill high in heaven I hear that throng\nWho march in mystic paths along,\nGreat Pleiades, The Lyre,\nThe Te-Deum of the ages swell,\nTo earth-tuned ear inaudible.",

While for one reason or another, sadness consumes you, at the same time you could be quite happy. For example; I am naturally a happy person. Therefor  while I may feel constant sadness about a certain situation,  I may still be basking; or somewhat happy. (smiling, laughing, having a good time)\nMany people have a sadness inside them that is hidden, or  in the back of their mind at all times. These people are probably happy, can have fun, and seem to be in good cheer, while the sadness is still there, in their minds or hearts.\nTherefor; we bask in sorrow.\nHere we sit and bask in sorrow\nSecretly begging for the morrow\nA smile upon the outside face\nStrength that shows as we run our race\nHappiness is never too far away\nGenuine cheer throughout the day\nBut a certain sadness wears us down\nAnd being alone makes us frown\nFor this is what causes our heartache and grief\nIt hides under smiles, the sly little thief\nSo though we are basking in our sorrow today\nWe might soon find something to keep it at bay",

By Fancy's aid\nThe happy husband flies, his arms to throw\nRound his wife's neck; the prize of victory laid\nIn her full lap, he sees such sweet tears flow\nAs if thenceforth nor pain nor trouble she could know.\nVIII\nVain hope! for frand took all that he had earned.\nThe lion roars and gluts his tawny brood\nEven in the desert's heart; but he, returned,\nBears not to those he loves their needful food.\nHis home approaching, but in such a mood\nThat from his sight his children might have run.\nHe met a traveller, robbed him, shed his blood;\nAnd when the miserable work was done\nHe fled, a vagrant since, the murderer's fate to shun.\nIX\nFrom that day forth no place to him could be\nSo lonely, but that thence might come a pang\nBrought from without to inward misery.\nNow, as he plodded on, with sullen clang\nA sound of chains along the desert rang;\nHe looked, and saw upon a gibbet high\nA human body that in irons swang,\nUplifted by the tempest whirling by;\nAnd, hovering, round it often did a raven fly.\nX\nIt was a spectacle which none might view,\nIn spot so savage, but with shuddering pain;\nNor only did for him at once renew\nAll he had feared from man, but roused a train\nOf the mind's phantoms, horrible as vain.\nThe stones, as if to cover him from day,\nRolled at his back along the living plain;\nHe fell, and without sense or motion lay;\nBut, when the trance was gone, feebly pursued his way.\nXI\nAs one whose brain habitual phrensy fires\nOwes to the fit in which his soul hath tossed\nProfounder quiet, when the fit retires,\nEven so the dire phantasma which had crossed\nHis sense, in sudden vacancy quite lost,\nLeft his mind still as a deep evening stream.\nNor, if accosted now, in thought engrossed,\nMoody, or inly troubled, would he seem\nTo traveller who might talk of any casual theme.\nXII\nHurtle the clouds in deeper darkness piled,\nGone is the raven timely rest to seek;\nHe seemed the only creature in the wild\nOn whom the elements their rage might wreak;\nSave that the bustard, of those regions bleak\nShy tenant, seeing by the uncertain light\nA man there wandering, gave a mournful shriek,\nAnd half upon the ground, with strange affright,\nForced hard against the wind a thick unwieldy flight.\nXIII\nAll, all was cheerless to the horizon's bound;\nThe weary eye--which, wheresoe'er it strays,\nMarks nothing but the red sun's setting round,\nOr on the earth strange lines, in former days\nLeft by gigantic arms--at length surveys\nWhat seems an antique castle spreading wide;\nHoary and naked are its walls, and raise\nTheir brow sublime: in shelter there to bide\nHe turned, while rain poured down smoking on every side.\nXIV\nPile of Stone-henge! so proud to hint yet keep\nThy secrets, thou that lov'st to stand and hear\nThe Plain resounding to the whirlwind's sweep,\nInmate of lonesome Nature's endless year;\nEven if thou saw'st the giant wicker rear\nFor sacrifice its throngs of living men,\nBefore thy face did ever wretch appear,\nWho in his heart had groaned with deadlier pain\nThan he who, tempest-driven, thy shelter now would gain.\nXV\nWithin that fabric of mysterious form,\nWinds met in conflict, each by turns supreme;\nAnd, from the perilous ground dislodged, through storm\nAnd rain he wildered on, no moon to stream\nFrom gulf of parting clouds one friendly beam,\nNor any friendly sound his footsteps led;\nOnce did the lightning's faint disastrous gleam\nDisclose a naked guide-post's double head,\nSight which tho' lost at once a gleam of pleasure shed.\nXVI\nNo swinging sign-board creaked from cottage elm\nTo stay his steps with faintness overcome;\n'Twas dark and void as ocean's watery realm\nRoaring with storms beneath night's starless gloom;\nNo gipsy cowered o'er fire of furze or broom;\nNo labourer watched his red kiln glaring bright,\nNor taper glimmered dim from sick man's room;\nAlong the waste no line of mournful light\nFrom lamp of lonely toll-gate streamed athwart the night.\nXVII\nAt length, though hid in clouds, the moon arose;\nThe downs were visible--and now revealed\nA structure stands, which two bare slopes enclose.\nIt was a spot, where, ancient vows fulfilled,\nKind pious hands did to the Virgin build\nA lonely Spital, the belated swain\nFrom the night terrors of that waste to shield:\nBut there no human being could remain,\nAnd now the walls are named the \"Dead House\" of the plain.\nXVIII\nThough he had little cause to love the abode\nOf man, or covet sight of mortal face,\nYet when faint beams of light that ruin showed,\nHow glad he was at length to find some trace\nOf human shelter in that dreary place.\nTill to his flock the early shepherd goes,\nHere shall much-needed sleep his frame embrace.\nIn a dry nook where fern the floor bestrows\nHe lays his stiffened limbs,--his eyes begin to close;\nXIX\nWhen hearing a deep sigh, that seemed to come\nFrom one who mourned in sleep, he raised his head,\nAnd saw a woman in the naked room\nOutstretched, and turning on a restless bed:\nThe moon a wan dead light around her shed.\nHe waked her--spake in tone that would not fail,\nHe hoped, to calm her mind; but ill he sped,\nFor of that ruin she had heard a tale\nWhich now with freezing thoughts did all her powers assail;\nXX\nHad heard of one who, forced from storms to shroud,\nFelt the loose walls of this decayed Retreat\nRock to incessant neighings shrill and loud,\nWhile his horse pawed the floor with furious heat;\nTill on a stone, that sparkled to his feet,\nStruck, and still struck again, the troubled horse:\nThe man half raised the stone with pain and sweat,\nHalf raised, for well his arm might lose its force\nDisclosing the grim head of a late murdered corse.\nXXI\nSuch tale of this lone mansion she had learned\nAnd, when that shape, with eyes in sleep half drowned,\nBy the moon's sullen lamp she first discerned,\nCold stony horror all her senses bound.\nHer he addressed in words of cheering sound;\nRecovering heart, like answer did she make;\nAnd well it was that, of the corse there found,\nIn converse that ensued she nothing spake;\nShe knew not what dire pangs in him such tale could wake.\nXXII\nBut soon his voice and words of kind intent\nBanished that dismal thought; and now the wind\nIn fainter howlings told its 'rage' was spent:\nMeanwhile discourse ensued of various kind,\nWhich by degrees a confidence of mind\nAnd mutual interest failed not to create.\nAnd, to a natural sympathy resigned,\nIn that forsaken building where they sate\nThe Woman thus retraced her own untoward fate.\nXXIII\n\"By Derwent's side my father dwelt--a man\nOf virtuous life, by pious parents bred;\nAnd I believe that, soon as I began\nTo lisp, he made me kneel beside my bed,\nAnd in his hearing there my prayers I said:\nAnd afterwards, by my good father taught,\nI read, and loved the books in which I read;\nFor books in every neighbouring house I sought,\nAnd nothing to my mind a sweeter pleasure brought.\nXXIV\n\"A little croft we owned--a plot of corn,\nA garden stored with peas, and mint, and thyme,\nAnd flowers for posies, oft on Sunday morn\nPlucked while the church bells rang their earliest chime.\nCan I forget our freaks at shearing time!\nMy hen's rich nest through long grass scarce espied;\nThe cowslip-gathering in June's dewy prime;\nThe swans that with white chests upreared in pride\nRushing and racing came to meet me at the water-side.\nXXV\n\"The staff I well remember which upbore\nThe bending body of my active sire;\nHis seat beneath the honied sycamore\nWhere the bees hummed, and chair by winter fire;\nWhen market-morning came, the neat attire\nWith which, though bent on haste, myself I decked;\nOur watchful house-dog, that would tease and tire\nThe stranger till its barking-fit I checked;\nThe red-breast, known for years, which at my casement pecked.\nXXVI\n\"The suns of twenty summers danced along,--\nToo little marked how fast they rolled away:\nBut, through severe mischance and cruel wrong,\nMy father's substance fell into decay:\nWe toiled and struggled, hoping for a day\nWhen Fortune might put on a kinder look;\nBut vain were wishes, efforts vain as they;\nHe from his old hereditary nook\nMust part; the summons came;--our final leave we took.\nXXVII\n\"It was indeed a miserable hour\nWhen, from the last hill-top, my sire surveyed,\nPeering above the trees, the steeple tower\nThat on his marriage day sweet music made!\nTilt then, he hoped his bones might there be laid\nClose by my mother in their native bowers:\nBidding me trust in God, he stood and prayed;--\nI could not pray:--through tears that fell in showers\nGlimmered our dear-loved home, alas! no longer ours!\nXXVIII\n\"There was a Youth whom I had loved so long,\nThat when I loved him not I cannot say:\n'Mid the green mountains many a thoughtless song\nWe two had sung, like gladsome birds in May;\nWhen we began to tire of childish play,\nWe seemed still more and more to prize each other;\nWe talked of marriage and our marriage day;\nAnd I in truth did love him like a brother,\nFor never could I hope to meet with such another.\nXXIX\n\"Two years were passed since to a distant town\nHe had repaired to ply a gainful trade:\nWhat tears of bitter grief, till then unknown!\nWhat tender vows, our last sad kiss delayed!\nTo him we turned:--we had no other aid:\nLike one revived, upon his neck I wept;\nAnd her whom he had loved in joy, he said,\nHe well could love in grief; his faith he kept;\nAnd in a quiet home once more my father slept.\nXXX\n\"We lived in peace and comfort; and were blest\nWith daily bread, by constant toil supplied.\nThree lovely babes had lain upon my breast;\nAnd often, viewing their sweet smiles, I sighed,\nAnd knew not why. My happy father died,\nWhen threatened war reduced the children's meal:\nThrice happy! that for him the grave could hide\nThe empty loom, cold hearth, and silent wheel,\nAnd tears that flowed for ills which patience might not heal.\nXXXI\n\"'Twas a hard change; an evil time was come;\nWe had no hope, and no relief could gain:\nBut soon, with proud parade, the noisy drum\nBeat round to clear the streets of want and pain.\nMy husband's arms now only served to strain\nMe and his children hungering in his view;\nIn such dismay my prayers and tears were vain:\nTo join those miserable men he flew,\nAnd now to the sea-coast, with numbers more, we drew.\nXXXII\n\"There were we long neglected, and we bore\nMuch sorrow ere the fleet its anchor weighed;\nGreen fields before us, and our native shore,\nWe breathed a pestilential air, that made\nRavage for which no knell was heard. We prayed\nFor our departure; wished and wished--nor knew,\n'Mid that long sickness and those hopes delayed,\nThat happier days we never more must view.\nThe parting signal streamed--at last the land withdrew.\nXXXIII\n\"But the calm summer season now was past.\nOn as we drove, the equinoctial deep\nRan mountains high before the howling blast,\nAnd many perished in the whirlwind's sweep.\nWe gazed with terror on their gloomy sleep,\nUntaught that soon such anguish must ensue,\nOur hopes such harvest of affliction reap,\nThat we the mercy of the waves should rue:\nWe reached the western world, a poor devoted crew.\nXXXIV\n\"The pains and plagues that on our heads came down,\nDisease and famine, agony and fear,\nIn wood or wilderness, in camp or town,\nIt would unman the firmest heart to hear.\nAll perished--all in one remorseless year,\nHusband and children! one by one, by sword\nAnd ravenous plague, all perished: every tear\nDried up, despairing, desolate, on board\nA British ship I waked, as from a trance restored.\"\nXXXV\nHere paused she of all present thought forlorn,\nNor voice nor sound, that moment's pain expressed,\nYet Nature, with excess of grief o'erborne,\nFrom her full eyes their watery load released.\nHe too was mute; and, ere her weeping ceased,\nHe rose, and to the ruin's portal went,\nAnd saw the dawn opening the silvery east\nWith rays of promise, north and southward sent;\nAnd soon with crimson fire kindled the firmament.\nXXXVI\n\"O come,\" he cried, \"come, after weary night\nOf such rough storm, this happy change to view.\"\nSo forth she came, and eastward looked; the sight\nOver her brow like dawn of gladness threw;\nUpon her cheek, to which its youthful hue\nSeemed to return, dried the last lingering tear,\nAnd from her grateful heart a fresh one drew:\nThe whilst her comrade to her pensive cheer\nTempered fit words of hope; and the lark warbled near.\nXXXVII\nThey looked and saw a lengthening road, and wain\nThat rang down a bare slope not far remote:\nThe barrows glistered bright with drops of rain,\nWhistled the waggoner with merry note,\nThe cock far off sounded his clarion throat;\nBut town, or farm, or hamlet, none they viewed,\nOnly were told there stood a lonely cot\nA long mile thence. While thither they pursued\nTheir way, the Woman thus her mournful tale renewed.\nXXXVIII\n\"Peaceful as this immeasurable plain\nIs now, by beams of dawning light imprest,\nIn the calm sunshine slept the glittering main;\nThe very ocean hath its hour of rest.\nI too forgot the heavings of my breast.\nHow quiet 'round me ship and ocean were!\nAs quiet all within me. I was blest,\nAnd looked, and fed upon the silent air\nUntil it seemed to bring a joy to my despair.\nXXXIX\n\"Ah! how unlike those late terrific sleeps,\nAnd groans that rage of racking famine spoke;\nThe unburied dead that lay in festering heaps,\nThe breathing pestilence that rose like smoke,\nThe shriek that from the distant battle broke,\nThe mine's dire earthquake, and the pallid host\nDriven by the bomb's incessant thunderstroke\nTo loathsome vaults, where heart-sick anguish tossed,\nHope died, and fear itself in agony was lost!\nXL\n\"Some mighty gulf of separation past,\nI seemed transported to another world;\nA thought resigned with pain, when from the mast\nThe impatient mariner the sail unfurled,\nAnd, whistling, called the wind that hardly curled\nThe silent sea. From the sweet thoughts of home\nAnd from all hope I was for ever hurled.\nFor me--farthest from earthly port to roam\nWas best, could I but shun the spot where man might come.\nXLI\n\"And oft I thought (my fancy was so strong)\nThat I, at last, a resting-place had found;\n'Here will I dwell,' said I, 'my whole life long,\nRoaming the illimitable waters round;\nHere will I live, of all but heaven disowned,\nAnd end my days upon the peaceful flood.'--\nTo break my dream the vessel reached its bound;\nAnd homeless near a thousand homes I stood,\nAnd near a thousand tables pined and wanted food.\nXLII\n\"No help I sought; in sorrow turned adrift,\nWas hopeless, as if cast on some bare rock;\nNor morsel to my mouth that day did lift,\nNor raised my hand at any door to knock.\nI lay where, with his drowsy mates, the cock\nFrom the cross-timber of an out-house hung:\nDismally tolled, that night, the city clock!\nAt morn my sick heart hunger scarcely stung,\nNor to the beggar's language could I fit my tongue.\nXLIII\n\"So passed a second day; and, when the third\nWas come, I tried in vain the crowd's resort.\n--In deep despair, by frightful wishes stirred,\nNear the sea-side I reached a ruined fort;\nThere, pains which nature could no more support,\nWith blindness linked, did on my vitals fall;\nAnd, after many interruptions short\nOf hideous sense, I sank, nor step could crawl:\nUnsought for was the help that did my life recall.\nXLIV\n\"Borne to a hospital, I lay with brain\nDrowsy and weak, and shattered memory;\nI heard my neighbours in their beds complain\nOf many things which never troubled me--\nOf feet still bustling round with busy glee,\nOf looks where common kindness had no part,\nOf service done with cold formality,\nFretting the fever round the languid heart,\nAnd groans which, as they said, might make a dead man start.\nXLV\n\"These things just served to stir the slumbering sense,\nNor pain nor pity in my bosom raised.\nWith strength did memory return; and, thence\nDismissed, again on open day I gazed,\nAt houses, men, and common light, amazed.\nThe lanes I sought, and, as the sun retired,\nCame where beneath the trees a faggot blazed,\nThe travellers saw me weep, my fate inquired,\nAnd gave me food--and rest, more welcome, more desired.\nXLVI\n\"Rough potters seemed they, trading soberly\nWith panniered asses driven from door to door;\nBut life of happier sort set forth to me,\nAnd other joys my fancy to allure--\nThe bag-pipe dinning on the midnight moor\nIn barn uplighted; and companions boon,\nWell met from far with revelry secure\nAmong the forest glades, while jocund June\nRolled fast along the sky his warm and genial moon.\nXLVII\n\"But ill they suited me--those journeys dark\nO'er moor and mountain, midnight theft to hatch!\nTo charm the surly house-dog's faithful bark,\nOr hang on tip-toe at the lifted latch.\nThe gloomy lantern, and the dim blue match,\nThe black disguise, the warning whistle shrill,\nAnd ear still busy on its nightly watch,\nWere not for me, brought up in nothing ill:\nBesides, on griefs so fresh my thoughts were brooding still.\nXLVIII\n\"What could I do, unaided and unblest?\nMy father! gone was every friend of thine:\nAnd kindred of dead husband are at best\nSmall help; and, after marriage such as mine,\nWith little kindness would to me incline.\nNor was I then for toil or service fit;\nMy deep-drawn sighs no effort could confine;\nIn open air forgetful would I sit\nWhole hours, with idle arms in moping sorrow knit.\nXLIX\n\"The roads I paced, I loitered through the fields;\nContentedly, yet sometimes self-accused.\nTrusted my life to what chance bounty yields,\nNow coldly given, now utterly refused.\nThe ground I for my bed have often used:\nBut what afflicts my peace with keenest ruth,\nIs that I have my inner self abused,\nForegone the home delight of constant truth,\nAnd clear and open soul, so prized in fearless youth.\nL\n\"Through tears the rising sun I oft have viewed,\nThrough tears have seen him towards that world descend\nWhere my poor heart lost all its fortitude:\nThree years a wanderer now my course I bend--\nOh! tell me whither--for no earthly friend\nHave I.\"--She ceased, and weeping turned away;\nAs if because her tale was at an end,\nShe wept; because she had no more to say\nOf that perpetual weight which on her spirit lay.\nLI\nTrue sympathy the Sailor's looks expressed,\nHis looks--for pondering he was mute the while.\nOf social Order's care for wretchedness,\nOf Time's sure help to calm and reconcile,\nJoy's second spring and Hope's long-treasured smile,\n'Twas not for 'him' to speak--a man so tried,\nYet, to relieve her heart, in friendly style\nProverbial words of comfort he applied,\nAnd not in vain, while they went pacing side by side.\nLII\nEre long, from heaps of turf, before their sight,\nTogether smoking in the sun's slant beam,\nRise various wreaths that into one unite\nWhich high and higher mounts with silver gleam:\nFair spectacle,---but instantly a scream\nThence bursting shrill did all remark prevent;\nThey paused, and heard a hoarser voice blaspheme,\nAnd female cries. Their course they thither bent,\nAnd met a man who foamed with anger vehement,\nLIII\nA woman stood with quivering lips and pale,\nAnd, pointing to a little child that lay\nStretched on the ground, began a piteous tale;\nHow in a simple freak of thoughtless play\nHe had provoked his father, who straightway,\nAs if each blow were deadlier than the last,\nStruck the poor innocent. Pallid with dismay\nThe Soldier's Widow heard and stood aghast;\nAnd stern looks on the man her grey-haired Comrade cast.\nLIV\nHis voice with indignation rising high\nSuch further deed in manhood's name forbade;\nThe peasant, wild in passion, made reply\nWith bitter insult and revilings sad;\nAsked him in scorn what business there he had;\nWhat kind of plunder he was hunting now;\nThe gallows would one day of him be glad;--\nThough inward anguish damped the Sailor's brow,\nYet calm he seemed as thoughts so poignant would allow.\nLV\nSoftly he stroked the child, who lay outstretched\nWith face to earth; and, as the boy turned round\nHis battered head, a groan the Sailor fetched\nAs if he saw--there and upon that ground--\nStrange repetition of the deadly wound\nHe had himself inflicted. Through his brain\nAt once the griding iron passage found;\nDeluge of tender thoughts then rushed amain,\nNor could his sunken eyes the starting tear restrain.\nLVI\nWithin himself he said--What hearts have we!\nThe blessing this a father gives his child!\nYet happy thou, poor boy! compared with me,\nSuffering not doing ill--fate far more mild.\nThe stranger's looks and tears of wrath beguiled\nThe father, and relenting thoughts awoke;\nHe kissed his son--so all was reconciled.\nThen, with a voice which inward trouble broke\nEre to his lips it came, the Sailor them bespoke.\nLVII\n\"Bad is the world, and hard is the world's law\nEven for the man who wears the warmest fleece;\nMuch need have ye that time more closely draw\nThe bond of nature, all unkindness cease,\nAnd that among so few there still be peace:\nElse can ye hope but with such numerous foes\nYour pains shall ever with your years increase?\"--\nWhile from his heart the appropriate lesson flows,\nA correspondent calm stole gently o'er his woes.\nLVIII\nForthwith the pair passed on; and down they look\nInto a narrow valley's pleasant scene\nWhere wreaths of vapour tracked a winding brook,\nThat babbled on through groves and meadows green;\nA low-roofed house peeped out the trees between;\nThe dripping groves resound with cheerful lays,\nAnd melancholy lowings intervene\nOf scattered herds, that in the meadow graze,\nSome amid lingering shade, some touched by the sun's rays.\nLIX\nThey saw and heard, and, winding with the road,\nDown a thick wood, they dropt into the vale;\nComfort, by prouder mansions unbestowed,\nTheir wearied frames, she hoped, would soon regale.\nErelong they reached that cottage in the dale:\nIt was a rustic inn;--the board was spread,\nThe milk-maid followed with her brimming pail,\nAnd lustily the master carved the bread,\nKindly the housewife pressed, and they in comfort fed.\nLX\nTheir breakfast done, the pair, though loth, must part;\nWanderers whose course no longer now agrees.\nShe rose and bade farewell! and, while her heart\nStruggled with tears nor could its sorrow ease,\nShe left him there; for, clustering round his knees,\nWith his oak-staff the cottage children played;\nAnd soon she reached a spot o'erhung with trees\nAnd banks of ragged earth; beneath the shade\nAcross the pebbly road a little runnel strayed.\nLXI\nA cart and horse beside the rivulet stood;\nChequering the canvas roof the sunbeams shone.\nShe saw the carman bend to scoop the flood\nAs the wain fronted her,--wherein lay one,\nA pale-faced Woman, in disease far gone.\nThe carman wet her lips as well behoved;\nBed under her lean body there was none,\nThough even to die near one she most had loved\nShe could not of herself those wasted limbs have moved.\nLXII\nThe Soldier's Widow learned with honest pain\nAnd homefelt force of sympathy sincere,\nWhy thus that worn-out wretch must there sustain\nThe jolting road and morning air severe.\nThe wain pursued its way; and following near\nIn pure compassion she her steps retraced\nFar as the cottage. \"A sad sight is here,\"\nShe cried aloud; and forth ran out in haste\nThe friends whom she had left but a few minutes past.\nLXIII\nWhile to the door with eager speed they ran,\nFrom her bare straw the Woman half upraised\nHer bony visage--gaunt and deadly wan;\nNo pity asking, on the group she gazed\nWith a dim eye, distracted and amazed;\nThen sank upon her straw with feeble moan.\nFervently cried the housewife--\"God be praised,\nI have a house that I can call my own;\nNor shall she perish there, untended and alone!\"\nLXIV\nSo in they bear her to the chimney seat,\nAnd busily, though yet with fear, untie\nHer garments, and, to warm her icy feet\nAnd chafe her temples, careful hands apply.\nNature reviving, with a deep-drawn sigh\nShe strove, and not in vain, her head to rear;\nThen said--\"I thank you all; if I must die,\nThe God in heaven my prayers for you will hear;\nTill now I did not think my end had been so near.\nLXV\n\"Barred every comfort labour could procure,\nSuffering what no endurance could assuage,\nI was compelled to seek my father's door,\nThough loth to be a burthen on his age.\nBut sickness stopped me in an early stage\nOf my sad journey; and within the wain\nThey placed me--there to end life's pilgrimage,\nUnless beneath your roof I may remain;\nFor I shall never see my father's door again.\nLXVI\n\"My life, Heaven knows, hath long been burthensome;\nBut, if I have not meekly suffered, meek\nMay my end be! Soon will this voice be dumb:\nShould child of mine e'er wander hither, speak\nOf me, say that the worm is on my cheek.--\nTorn from our hut, that stood beside the sea\nNear Portland lighthouse in a lonesome creek,\nMy husband served in sad captivity\nOn shipboard, bound till peace or death should set him free.\nLXVII\n\"A sailor's wife I knew a widow's cares,\nYet two sweet little ones partook my bed;\nHope cheered my dreams, and to my daily prayers\nOur heavenly Father granted each day's bread;\nTill one was found by stroke of violence dead,\nWhose body near our cottage chanced to lie;\nA dire suspicion drove us from our shed;\nIn vain to find a friendly face we try,\nNor could we live together those poor boys and I;\nLXVIII\n\"For evil tongues made oath how on that day\nMy husband lurked about the neighbourhood;\nNow he had fled, and whither none could say,\nAnd 'he' had done the deed in the dark wood--\nNear his own home!--but he was mild and good;\nNever on earth was gentler creature seen;\nHe'd not have robbed the raven of its food.\nMy husband's lovingkindness stood between\nMe and all worldly harms and wrongs however keen.\"\nLXIX\nAlas! the thing she told with labouring breath\nThe Sailor knew too well. That wickedness\nHis hand had wrought; and when, in the hour of death,\nHe saw his Wife's lips move his name to bless\nWith her last words, unable to suppress\nHis anguish, with his heart he ceased to strive;\nAnd, weeping loud in this extreme distress,\nHe cried--\"Do pity me! That thou shouldst live\nI neither ask nor wish--forgive me, but forgive!\"\nLXX\nTo tell the change that Voice within her wrought\nNature by sign or sound made no essay;\nA sudden joy surprised expiring thought,\nAnd every mortal pang dissolved away.\nBorne gently to a bed, in death she lay;\nYet still while over her the husband bent,\nA look was in her face which seemed to say,\n\"Be blest; by sight of thee from heaven was sent\nPeace to my parting soul, the fulness of content.\"\nLXXI\n'She' slept in peace,--his pulses throbbed and stopped,\nBreathless he gazed upon her face,--then took\nHer hand in his, and raised it, but both dropped,\nWhen on his own he cast a rueful look.\nHis ears were never silent; sleep forsook\nHis burning eyelids stretched and stiff as lead;\nAll night from time to time under him shook\nThe floor as he lay shuddering on his bed;\nAnd oft he groaned aloud, \"O God, that I were dead!\"\nLXXII\nThe Soldier's Widow lingered in the cot,\nAnd, when he rose, he thanked her pious care\nThrough which his Wife, to that kind shelter brought,\nDied in his arms; and with those thanks a prayer\nHe breathed for her, and for that merciful pair.\nThe corse interred, not one hour heremained\nBeneath their roof, but to the open air\nA burthen, now with fortitude sustained,\nHe bore within a breast where dreadful quiet reigned.\nLXXIII\nConfirmed of purpose, fearlessly prepared\nFor act and suffering, to the city straight\nHe journeyed, and forthwith his crime declared:\n\"And from your doom,\" he added, \"now I wait,\nNor let it linger long, the murderer's fate.\"\nNot ineffectual was that piteous claim:\n\"O welcome sentence which will end though late,\"\nHe said, \"the pangs that to my conscience came\nOut of that deed. My trust, Saviour! is in thy name!\"\nLXXIV\nHis fate was pitied. Him in iron case\n(Reader, forgive the intolerable thought)\nThey hung not:--no one on 'his' form or face\nCould gaze, as on a show by idlers sought;\nNo kindred sufferer, to his death-place brought\nBy lawless curiosity or chance,\nWhen into storm the evening sky is wrought,\nUpon his swinging corse an eye can glance,\nAnd drop, as he once dropped, in miserable trance.",

They bathed her in the FlowerPure Pool,\nWhich warmed and smoothed the creamy-tinted crystal of her skin,\nAnd, because of her languor, a maid was lifting her\nWhen first the Emperor noticed her and chose her for his bride.\nThe cloud of her hair, petal of her cheek, gold ripples of her crown when she moved,\nWere sheltered on spring evenings by warm hibiscus curtains;\nBut nights of spring were short and the sun arose too soon,\nAnd the Emperor, from that time forth, forsook his early hearings\nAnd lavished all his time on her with feasts and revelry,\nHis mistress of the spring, his despot of the night.\nThere were other ladies in his court, three thousand of rare beauty,\nBut his favours to three thousand were concentered in one body.\nBy the time she was dressed in her Golden Chamber, it would be almost evening;\nAnd when tables were cleared in the Tower of Jade, she would loiter, slow with wine.\nHer sisters and her brothers all were given titles;\nAnd, because she so illumined and glorified her clan,\nShe brought to every father, every mother through the empire,\nHappiness when a girl was born rather than a boy.\n...High rose Li Palace, entering blue clouds,\nAnd far and wide the breezes carried magical notes\nOf soft song and slow dance, of string and bamboo music.\nThe Emperor's eyes could never gaze on her enough-\nTill war-drums, booming from Yuyang, shocked the whole earth\nAnd broke the tunes of The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.\nThe Forbidden City, the nine-tiered palace, loomed in the dust\nFrom thousands of horses and chariots headed southwest.\nThe imperial flag opened the way, now moving and now pausing- -\nBut thirty miles from the capital, beyond the western gate,\nThe men of the army stopped, not one of them would stir\nTill under their horses' hoofs they might trample those moth- eyebrows....\nFlowery hairpins fell to the ground, no one picked them up,\nAnd a green and white jade hair-tassel and a yellowgold hair- bird.\nThe Emperor could not save her, he could only cover his face.\nAnd later when he turned to look, the place of blood and tears\nWas hidden in a yellow dust blown by a cold wind.\n... At the cleft of the Dagger-Tower Trail they crisscrossed through a cloud-line\nUnder Omei Mountain. The last few came.\nFlags and banners lost their colour in the fading sunlight....\nBut as waters of Shu are always green and its mountains always blue,\nSo changeless was His Majesty's love and deeper than the days.\nHe stared at the desolate moon from his temporary palace.\nHe heard bell-notes in the evening rain, cutting at his breast.\nAnd when heaven and earth resumed their round and the dragon car faced home,\nThe Emperor clung to the spot and would not turn away\nFrom the soil along the Mawei slope, under which was buried\nThat memory, that anguish. Where was her jade-white face?\nRuler and lords, when eyes would meet, wept upon their coats\nAs they rode, with loose rein, slowly eastward, back to the capital.\n...The pools, the gardens, the palace, all were just as before,\nThe Lake Taiye hibiscus, the Weiyang Palace willows;\nBut a petal was like her face and a willow-leaf her eyebrow --\nAnd what could he do but cry whenever he looked at them?\n...Peach-trees and plum-trees blossomed, in the winds of spring;\nLakka-foliage fell to the ground, after autumn rains;\nThe Western and Southern Palaces were littered with late grasses,\nAnd the steps were mounded with red leaves that no one swept away.\nHer Pear-Garden Players became white-haired\nAnd the eunuchs thin-eyebrowed in her Court of PepperTrees;\nOver the throne flew fire-flies, while he brooded in the twilight.\nHe would lengthen the lamp-wick to its end and still could never sleep.\nBell and drum would slowly toll the dragging nighthours\nAnd the River of Stars grow sharp in the sky, just before dawn,\nAnd the porcelain mandarin-ducks on the roof grow thick with morning frost\nAnd his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder\nWith the distance between life and death year after year;\nAnd yet no beloved spirit ever visited his dreams.\n...At Lingqiong lived a Taoist priest who was a guest of heaven,\nAble to summon spirits by his concentrated mind.\nAnd people were so moved by the Emperor's constant brooding\nThat they besought the Taoist priest to see if he could find her.\nHe opened his way in space and clove the ether like lightning,\nUp to heaven, under the earth, looking everywhere.\nAbove, he searched the Green Void, below, the Yellow Spring;\nBut he failed, in either place, to find the one he looked for.\nAnd then he heard accounts of an enchanted isle at sea,\nA part of the intangible and incorporeal world,\nWith pavilions and fine towers in the five-coloured air,\nAnd of exquisite immortals moving to and fro,\nAnd of one among them-whom they called The Ever True-\nWith a face of snow and flowers resembling hers he sought.\nSo he went to the West Hall's gate of gold and knocked at the jasper door\nAnd asked a girl, called Morsel-of-Jade, to tell The Doubly- Perfect.\nAnd the lady, at news of an envoy from the Emperor of China,\nWas startled out of dreams in her nine-flowered, canopy.\nShe pushed aside her pillow, dressed, shook away sleep,\nAnd opened the pearly shade and then the silver screen.\nHer cloudy hair-dress hung on one side because of her great haste,\nAnd her flower-cap was loose when she came along the terrace,\nWhile a light wind filled her cloak and fluttered with her motion\nAs though she danced The Rainbow Skirt and the Feathered Coat.\nAnd the tear-drops drifting down her sad white face\nWere like a rain in spring on the blossom of the pear.\nBut love glowed deep within her eyes when she bade him thank her liege,\nWhose form and voice had been strange to her ever since their parting --\nSince happiness had ended at the Court of the Bright Sun,\nAnd moons and dawns had become long in Fairy-Mountain Palace.\nBut when she turned her face and looked down toward the earth\nAnd tried to see the capital, there were only fog and dust.\nSo she took out, with emotion, the pledges he had given\nAnd, through his envoy, sent him back a shell box and gold hairpin,\nBut kept one branch of the hairpin and one side of the box,\nBreaking the gold of the hairpin, breaking the shell of the box;\n\"Our souls belong together,\" she said, \" like this gold and this shell --\nSomewhere, sometime, on earth or in heaven, we shall surely\nAnd she sent him, by his messenger, a sentence reminding him\nOf vows which had been known only to their two hearts:\n\"On the seventh day of the Seventh-month, in the Palace of Long Life,\nWe told each other secretly in the quiet midnight world\nThat we wished to fly in heaven, two birds with the wings of one,\nAnd to grow together on the earth, two branches of one tree.\"\nEarth endures, heaven endures; some time both shall end,\nWhile this unending sorrow goes on and on for ever.",
