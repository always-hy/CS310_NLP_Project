In counselling, we work together, collaboratively, to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care. Basically, it\u2019s like a road map of where you want to go, how are you going to get there, looking at stopovers, some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic, however, necessary. Of course, these plans can also change due to internal (what we have control over like our thoughts, feelings and behaviours) or external reasons (those things that are outside our control). I would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by co-journeying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia, depression and anxiety, as well as being a breast cancer survivor. Then to help you by developing new coping strategies. Psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be. I know you can do it and you will see first-hand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck.\u00a0I like to quote Nike where their motto is,\u00a0\u201cjust do it.\u201d\u00a0You can do it.",

For example, say \"I feel really sad and overwhelmed, and I need your support\" rather than \"You don't take me seriously.\"\n\n3. **Provide Information**: Sometimes partners need more understanding about mental health. Consider sharing articles or resources that explain depression and its effects. This might help him see it from a different perspective.\n\n4. **Ask for Specific Support**: Let him know what you need from him. This could be emotional support, helping you find professional help, or simply listening to you without judgment.\n\n5. **Encourage Open Dialogue**: Ask him how he feels about the situation and if there are any concerns he has regarding your feelings. Understanding both sides can help foster better communication.\n\n6. **Consider Professional Help**: If the situation doesn\u2019t improve, consider seeking therapy, either individually or as a couple. A therapist can provide support and facilitate conversations about mental health.\n\n7. **Set Boundaries**: If he continues to dismiss your feelings, it might be necessary to set boundaries regarding how that affects you emotionally.\n\n8. **Take Care of Yourself**: Prioritize your own well-being. Engage in activities that improve your mood and seek support from friends or a therapist, even if your husband isn\u2019t immediately on board.\n\nRemember, it can take time for someone to understand what you\u2019re going through, and that's okay. Focus on self-care and getting the support you need."

Sometimes, diving into sad music or tragic stories can open up a space for reflection and processing emotions, even if they\u2019re painful. It can also be a way of feeling something deeply when we might feel numb or disconnected otherwise.\n\nHowever, if you find that this habit is becoming overwhelming or preventing you from experiencing more positive emotions, it might be worth exploring those feelings further. Consider what draws you to this sadness. Are there underlying emotions or experiences that you\u2019re trying to navigate?

Balancing those experiences can lead to a richer understanding of yourself and your emotions."

If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term \"enabler\". A lot of the times, when people think they're \"helping\", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior.

Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place.

Encourage him to share his feelings without judgment.\n\n2. **Normalize Seeking Help**: You might remind him that many people face similar feelings and that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Sometimes sharing stories of others who have sought help successfully can make it feel less intimidating.\n\n3. **Suggest Professional Help**: If he is open to it, you could suggest seeing a counselor, therapist, or doctor who specializes in mental health.

They might be able to offer additional guidance or intervene if necessary.\n\n6. **Keep an Eye Out for Warning Signs**: If you notice signs that his condition is worsening or if he expresses feelings of self-harm or suicide, it\u2019s critical to take those seriously. In such cases, contacting a mental health professional or a crisis line can be essential.\n\n7. **Take Care of Yourself**: Supporting someone with depression can be emotionally taxing. Make sure you\u2019re looking after your own mental health too. Talk to someone about what you\u2019re feeling if you need to.\n\nYour concern is important, and being there for your friend can make a significant difference.

If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process.

        "Human": "Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes.",

It is best to get a referral for such a professional from a peer who has had a positive and safe experience with a particular provider.",
        "Generated": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're feeling this way. It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of complex emotions and situations, and it's completely understandable to feel overwhelmed. Here are a few thoughts that might help you navigate these difficult feelings:\n\n1. **Communicating with Your Parents**: It might be helpful to try talking to your parents in a different way. Sometimes, when emotions are high, it's hard for both sides to understand each other. Maybe express how their reactions make you feel rather than focusing on the events themselves. You could say something like, \"When I share something important, I feel like I'm not being heard.\" This might help them understand your perspective better.\n\n2. **Seeking Support**: If you feel that your friends are not fully supportive or attentive, try to find other outlets for your feelings. This could be a school counselor, a therapist, or even a support group. Speaking with someone trained to help can provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings.\n\n3. **Self-Care and Coping Strategies**: It's great that you've fought through depression; consider implementing self-care practices like journaling, art, or physical exercise, which can help relieve stress and anxiety. Mindfulness or meditation can also be a powerful tool to help you manage those feelings.\n\n4. **Building Trust**: It's hard to feel alone, especially with people you care about. If your friends aren't providing the support you need, perhaps reaching out to new people, joining clubs, or engaging in community activities can help you find individuals who might better understand you and be there when you need someone to talk to.\n\n5. **Acknowledging Your Feelings**: It's important to validate your own feelings. Recognizing that what you\u2019re experiencing is real and that it's okay to seek help is a strong step towards healing.\n\nRemember, you are not alone in feeling this way, and it can take time to find the right support. Seeking to express yourself and understand your feelings is a brave step forward."

He may not fully understand what you're going through unless you open up. Finding emotional support from him can strengthen your relationship and help alleviate feelings of inadequacy.\n\n5. **Reflect on Your Identity**: Take some time to explore who you are outside of these relationships. Engage in activities that bring you joy, enrich your sense of self, and reinforce your worth.

Reframe negative thoughts about yourself and remind yourself that you are worthy of love, respect, and happiness. Journaling can be an effective way to process this.\n\n7. **Focus on Your Journey**: Healing is not linear and can take time. It's okay to have setbacks. Continue to work on understanding your past and how it shapes your present. Each step you take towards healing is a step in the right direction.\n\nRemember that you are not alone, and there is support available to help you through this.

There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck.\u00a0Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort.\u00a0The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback.\u00a0First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it--\u00a0healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression, \u00a0work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support.

        "Context": "My depression has been reoccurring for a long time. It all started when I was being bullied in high school. In ninth grade, my principal told me I needed to stay home for a couple days to protect myself while she spoke to my classmates. I needed professional help for my stress because I was having crying spells from the stress of going to school and confronting my classmates. After that, I was fine for a couple of years. I entered my first year of college in a really tough program with high demands of expected work. I believe my depression re-booted from there with the stress. I began to cut myself because a friend of mine at the time told me how she used to do the same and it used to feel good for her. Obviously, that wasn't the right choice. I regret ever doing that, seeing as even though I'm not self-harming anymore, I always look back at that time whenever I feel very stressed. I have a big problem with handling problems in life. Whenever a problem arises, I get stressed and I feel hopeless, as if it's not going to get better. I get way too stressed from my problems, which leads to overreacting a lot (especially when talking to others), which then leads to depression. I have a hard time coping with stress because I know that if I could handle it easily then I wouldn't be sad all the time, and I would say and do the right thing instead of overreacting to my loved ones.",

Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time.\u00a0Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first?

The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization,\u00a0to get\u00a0follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter.\u00a0 So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always\u00a0a\u00a0good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again.

A full assessment/evaluation with a mental health professional is warranted to understand if indeed you meet criteria for a Major Depressive Disorder i.e.., are delressed. One thing I often tell patients is that \"Do you think you are depressed?\" People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed.

For example:\n     - Research training programs for electricians or heavy machinery operators.\n     - Look into local community colleges or trade schools that offer related courses.\n\n### 2. **Make a Plan**\n   - Create a timeline for achieving your goals. Set short-term and long-term goals to make the process manageable. For example:\n     - Short-term: Enroll in a program within the next three months.\n     - Long-term: Complete your training and obtain a license within the next one to two years.\n\n### 3. **Seek Support**\n   - Talk to your fianc\u00e9e about your aspirations, and involve her in the planning process. Supporting each other in pursuing your goals can strengthen your partnership.\n   - Connect with mentors in the fields you're interested in. They can provide valuable advice and encouragement.\n\n### 4. **Take Action**\n   - Start small; even minor steps can lead to significant progress. This might be as simple as filling out an application or having a conversation with someone in the field.\n   - Consider attending workshops or informational sessions related to your interests.\n\n### 5. **Build Skills and Experience**\n   - Look for part-time jobs, internships, or volunteer positions in your chosen field to gain experience.\n   - Online resources, videos, and tutorials can also help you learn skills relevant to your goals.\n\n### 6. **Stay Motivated**\n   - Remind yourself of why you want to achieve these goals. Having a clear vision of a better life for your family can help you stay focused.\n   - Celebrate small achievements along the way to keep your spirits high.\n\n### 7. **Consider Financial Planning**\n   - Look into financial aid, grants, or scholarships for training programs if cost is a concern.\n   - Create a budget that allows you to set aside money for training or education.\n\n### 8. **Stay Flexible**\n   - Life can be unpredictable, so remain open to adjusting your plans as needed. Focus on what you can control and stay resilient in the face of challenges.\n\nRemember, progress often comes in small steps, and it's okay to take your time.

        "Human": "Hello, and thank you for your question. First, I want to tell you how sorry I am for the experience you had with your parents. That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a\u00a0personal rejection rather than\u00a0response to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influence\u00a0others, so it\u00a0may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it.

Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations.

If you haven't seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It doesn't hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, don't be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are \"normal.\" These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition. It is important to remember that even if these symptoms are \"abnormal\" it doesn't mean that YOU are. Millions of people struggle with depression. So remember, the symptoms are the problem, not YOU.

For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. \u00a0When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. \u00a0In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue.

Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with \"emptiness.\" \u00a0In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having \"a lot on my mind\" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? \u00a0Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? \u00a0Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism?\u00a0We can feel \"alone\" even when in a crow of people or at a party. \u00a0This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people.

Consider trying new activities that excite you, whether it's a creative pursuit, physical activity, or learning something new.\n\n4. **Set Small Goals**: Start with small, achievable goals for yourself. This could be as simple as dedicating time to self-care, spending a few minutes each day reflecting on your thoughts and feelings, or learning a new skill. Celebrate each achievement, no matter how small.\n\n5. **Focus on Self-Care**: Make time for yourself, even if it's just a few moments each day. Prioritize activities that promote your well-being, such as exercise, mindfulness, or relaxation techniques.\n\n6. **Build Your Support Network**: Surround yourself with positive, supportive people who lift you up and can help you in your journey. This could include friends, family, or community members.\n\n7. **Reflect on Relationships**: Consider what you want in future relationships. Take time to reflect on what has and hasn't worked in the past, and think about what truly fulfills you.\n\n8. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Healing and rediscovering yourself is a process that takes time. Allow yourself to feel your emotions, and don't rush the journey.\n\nIt's okay to seek help and take time for yourself. Your experiences and feelings are valid, and you deserve support as you work toward healing and self-discovery."

One child is in a room full of every toy you could imagine, and he's miserable; the other is in a room full of horse manure, and he's flinging it around with joy. So then someone comes and asks the first boy why he's so miserable, because he has so much. He says that he's missing the one toy that he really wants. Then the brother is asked why he's so happy in a room full of manure, and he says \"With all this sh-t, there's gotta be a pony in here somewhere!\"Happiness is a state of mind, and I hear you saying that you used to be happy, so maybe this means you believe it's possible. That's a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say \"I always see the worst end of things\". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change.\u00a0The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. I know how to fix friendships), 2. Specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women.\u00a0The feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different.

My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works.\u00a0When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us.\u00a0So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support.\u00a0There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say \"Get off my back!\". \"You're not helping me by telling me lies.\" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self?

It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide.\u00a0Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\" \u00a0Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? \u00a0This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you.

This past time, it was extremely debilitating, so I went on Wellbutrin. I could feel the effects of the medicine after the first week. A month and a half later, I decided that my depression was being caused by my own unwillingness to move forward and address my behaviors and thoughts that were keeping me in a place of despair. I became worried that the medicine was making me complacent and prohibiting me from working out what I needed to in my life to bring back true fulfillment. I stopped taking it a month ago and feel okay; a lot of the anxiety it was paired with has gone away. However, I still don't feel my sense of self has been completely regained, and I have days where I feel a zombie-like haze of having no interests or the ability to fully concentrate on anything. Is it better to continue letting time and good habits work out the remaining depression or should I go back on the medicine?",

While I can't give you advice on whether or not to continue medication, I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and long-term costs and benefits of psychiatric medication. If you can find a doctor, psychiatrist, or ARNP who is competent in mental health, it may also benefit you to consult with them.One thing that I am wondering about is, what is your support system like, in regards to your fight against depression? Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group?

Additionally, engaging in activities you once enjoyed, even if you don't immediately feel the joy, can help rekindle interests over time.\n\n3. **Professional Support**: Consider talking to a mental health professional about your feelings and experiences. They can help you assess whether it's beneficial to resume medication or explore alternative therapies, such as therapy, mindfulness practices, or lifestyle adjustments.\n\n4. **Medication**: If you find that the symptoms start to interfere significantly with your daily life, it might be worth discussing medication options again with your healthcare provider. While some people do very well without medication, others find it essential for their well-being.\n\n5. **Gradual Change**: Transitioning away from medication can take time, and it's common to experience fluctuations in mood during this process.

She curls up in corners at the mall and has panic attacks. She won't eat or drink in public. If she isn't having a panic attack or crying, she's clinging to me and avoiding everything and everyone. Her depression flares up out of nowhere and causes her to become very suicidal and self-harming. She get really sick from anxiety and scared to the point that I can't even get her to eat, drink, leave the bed, or go outside. She always tells me how she grew up around so much fighting and fear that it makes her scared of loud sounds, yelling, conflict, and even talking to strangers in public.

A mental health professional can work with her to develop coping strategies and tools for managing her symptoms.\n\n2. **Psychiatric Service Dog:** As you've identified, a psychiatric service dog can provide emotional support and help mitigate anxiety in public spaces.

This could involve simple activities at first, such as stepping outside for short periods, sitting in a quiet public space with you, or eventually going to less crowded areas. It\u2019s important to proceed at her pace to avoid overwhelming her.\n\n4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and mindfulness can be effective in managing anxiety.

Participating in a support group might help her feel less isolated.\n\n6. **Monitoring Her Well-being:** If her suicidal thoughts or self-harming behavior continue, it's crucial to have a plan in place for crisis situations. This can include having emergency contacts, hotlines, or therapist information readily available.\n\n7. **Educated Discussions About Medication:** While you have reservations about medication, it could be helpful to have an open discussion with her about it. Some people find that medication, combined with therapy, significantly improves their quality of life. If she's open to it, a consultation with a psychiatrist could provide more clarity on her options.\n\n8. **Daily Routine:** Help her establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care activities, gentle exercise, or enjoying a hobby she loves, all in a low-pressure environment.\n\n9. **Patience and Support:** Above all, continue being supportive. Your presence and understanding can be incredibly powerful as she navigates her feelings and fears.\n\nEncourage her to take small steps and remind her that it's okay to seek help.

I know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hook-up\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. Research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn't work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.",
        "Generated": "I'm really sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds very challenging, and it's important to recognize that you're not alone in feeling this way. Many people experience anxiety and fear related to relationships, and there can be several underlying reasons for it:\n\n1. **Fear of Vulnerability**: Relationships often require us to be emotionally open and vulnerable, which can be scary. If you've been hurt in the past or if you're worried about being rejected, that fear can manifest as anxiety.\n\n2. **Fear of the Unknown**: The prospect of starting a relationship can be intimidating because it involves stepping into unfamiliar territory. You may feel pressure to meet expectations or fear what might happen if things don't go as planned.\n\n3. **Perfectionism**: If you hold yourself to high standards, you might fear that you won't measure up in a relationship, causing anxiety about how to present yourself or how to act.\n\n4. **Social Anxiety or Generalized Anxiety**: If you tend to feel anxious in social situations overall, it can magnify your feelings when it comes to dating. \n\n5. **Past Experiences**: Previous negative experiences in relationships or conflicts can lead to heightened anxiety about future interactions.\n\n6. **Overthinking**: You might be prone to overanalyzing situations, leading to increased worry about what could go wrong rather than enjoying the positives.\n\nHere are some strategies you might consider to help you navigate these feelings:\n\n1. **Self-Reflection**: Journaling about your feelings can help you pinpoint specific fears or thoughts that contribute to your anxiety. Understanding these triggers can be the first step in addressing them.\n\n2. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help manage anxiety symptoms and promote a sense of calm.\n\n3. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of jumping into a full-blown relationship, try to set smaller, manageable goals. These could include starting with friendships or casually dating to lessen the pressure you feel.\n\n4. **Talk about It**: Continue to share your feelings with someone you trust, like your sister or another friend. Sometimes just talking about your anxiety can help lessen its hold over you.\n\n5. **Therapy**: If you\u2019re comfortable with the idea, speaking to a therapist can provide you with professional support and coping strategies tailored to your needs.\n\n6. **Educate Yourself**: Reading about relationships, boundaries, and self-worth can help you feel more prepared and confident in dating situations.\n\n7. **Romanticizing the Situation**: Instead of viewing dating or a relationship as something that must lead to significant commitments, try to see it as an opportunity for fun and learning about yourself and others.\n\nBe kind to yourself as you navigate these feelings. It's completely okay to take your time and find a pace that works for you. You don\u2019t have to rush into anything until you feel ready."

He cried and told me \"I'm still in love with you, I never stopped loving you,\" and I cried tears of joy. I asked multiple times if he loved me and asked to make sure he wasn't just saying that because of me being so depressed. He promised and assured me he loved me.

Anytime\u00a0sadness causes thoughts of suicide or self harm, it is important to get help immediately.\u00a0A therapist can help you by validating your feelings and what you are going\u00a0through, while also working with you to move through the grieving process, adopt new hobbies, social outlets, and goals for your future.

It\u2019s common to feel attachment to someone you've shared so much with, even if they hurt you.\n\n2. **Self-Care**: Prioritize your well-being.

A professional can help you process your feelings and develop coping strategies as you navigate this challenging time.\n\n5. **Reflect on the Relationship**: Think about the aspects of the relationship that were healthy and fulfilling, as well as those that were not. Reflecting on both sides can give you clarity and help you understand why it might be healthy to move on.\n\n6. **Identify What You Need**: Take time to explore what you want and need in a relationship moving forward. Consider what qualities you value in a partner and how those align with your ex\u2019s behaviors.\n\n7. **Give Yourself Time**: Healing takes time, and it's often not a linear journey. Allow yourself to feel your emotions without judgment and recognize that it's okay to grieve the relationship.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable to feel hurt and question your worth, but remember that the end of this relationship doesn\u2019t define you.

        "Generated": "It's understandable to feel anxious about the prospect of seeking help for your mental health, especially with the concerns you have about potential diagnoses and treatment options. Here are some things to consider that might help you navigate this situation:\n\n1. **Seeking Help is Okay**: It's perfectly valid to seek help, especially if you've been feeling this way for a long time. Mental health professionals are trained to provide support and guidance tailored to your unique situation.\n\n2. **Confidentiality**: In most countries, health care providers are required to protect your privacy. Even if you receive a diagnosis, there are protections in place to ensure that your medical records remain confidential, especially regarding sensitive information like mental health. Generally, this information is not accessible to employers or schools without your consent.\n\n3. **Self-Help vs. Professional Help**: While self-help strategies can be beneficial, if you're finding it difficult to cope, seeking professional support may provide you with tools and strategies that you might not have considered. Therapy can help you work through your feelings in a safe environment, and many people find it more effective when combined with self-help methods.\n\n4. **Medication Concerns**: It's important to communicate your past experiences, such as your reaction to the medication, with your doctor. This can help them provide alternative treatments that feel safer for you. Not everyone is prescribed medication, and many people benefit from therapy alone.\n\n5. **Treatment Options**: There are various treatment options apart from medication, including talk therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and other modalities. Your treatment plan can be tailored based on what you feel comfortable with.\n\n6. **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)**: While ECT is still used in some cases, it's typically reserved for severe depression that hasn't responded to other treatments. It is not a common first-line treatment and is usually used when other options have failed.\n\n7. **Your Voice Matters**: Remember that you are an active participant in your mental health care. You can express your concerns, preferences, and treatment goals to any healthcare provider you see.\n\nIf you do decide to seek help, it might be helpful to prepare a list of your concerns and any questions you have to discuss with your provider. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of medication or specific treatment approaches, be honest about that as well. The goal is to find what works best for you in your journey toward better mental health."

Talking to your parents about how you feel can be challenging, but it might help to open up a conversation with them. Here are a few steps to consider:\n\n1. **Choose the Right Time and Place**: Find a quiet moment when you and your parents can sit down without distractions. This can help create a comfortable environment for the conversation.\n\n2. **Start Small**: You can begin by expressing that you\u2019ve been feeling down or struggling.

Whether it's talking more frequently, spending time together, or even seeking professional help, expressing what you need can guide them in how to best support you.\n\n5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you feel comfortable, you can also talk about the idea of seeing a counselor. They can provide support and coping strategies to help you deal with these feelings.\n\nRemember, it's okay to seek help, and your feelings are valid. Talking about them is a brave step. If you find it hard to talk to your parents directly, you might consider writing them a letter or journal to help clarify your thoughts before you have the conversation.

The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve.

Have you noticed similar behaviors or feelings arising in multiple situations?

Sometimes, understanding their perspective can help you find peace, even if it\u2019s difficult.\n\n4. **Work on Self-Esteem**: Often, feelings of worthlessness or abandonment stem from self-esteem issues. Try to engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself. This could be hobbies, exercise, or setting small goals and achieving them.\n\n5. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: When you start to feel that someone is abandoning you or doesn\u2019t want to be around you, try to challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if there\u2019s evidence to support those beliefs or if they are simply your mind playing tricks on you.\n\n6. **Communicate Openly**: When you feel neglected or anxious about a relationship, consider sharing your feelings with the other person. Open communication can help both parties understand each other better and strengthen the connection.\n\n7. **Professional Support**: If you find that your feelings of abandonment persist and are affecting your daily life, it might be beneficial to seek the help of a therapist or counselor.

This is not something that anyone should just \u201cwhite knuckle\u201d and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT.\u00a0There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life\u2019s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. \u201cYou are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.\u201d Another quote I like is \u201cYou will find a way or you will find an excuse.\u201d Don\u2019t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Don\u2019t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself.

When it comes to anxiety and social isolation, it's important to understand that these challenges can be deeply ingrained in our thought patterns and behaviors. Here are a few reasons why these feelings might be hard to overcome:\n\n1. **Cognitive Patterns**: Anxiety often involves negative thought patterns, such as catastrophizing or fearing worst-case scenarios. These thought patterns can become habitual, making it difficult to break out of them.\n\n2. **Fear of Judgment**: Social anxiety can stem from a fear of judgment or rejection by others. This fear can make social interactions feel overwhelming, leading to avoidance behaviors that can perpetuate feelings of isolation.\n\n3. **Reinforcement of Isolation**: When you experience anxiety in social situations, you might naturally withdraw, which can reinforce the feeling of isolation. The less you practice socializing, the more daunting it may feel when you try to engage with others.\n\n4. **Lack of Skills**: If you\u2019ve been isolated for an extended period, you may feel rusty when it comes to social skills. This lack of practice can increase anxiety and make social situations more intimidating.\n\n5. **Underlying Issues**: Sometimes, anxiety and isolation can be symptoms of deeper underlying issues, such as past trauma or unresolved conflicts. These issues may require professional support to address effectively.\n\n6. **Biological Factors**: Anxiety can have biological components too, such as imbalances in neurotransmitters. This can make it challenging to simply \u201cwill\u201d yourself to feel better.\n\n7. **Disconnection from Support Systems**: If you\u2019ve experienced social isolation, you may have lost touch with friends or support systems that can help you feel more connected and reduce anxiety.\n\nOvercoming anxiety and social isolation often takes time and effort. It may be helpful to consider strategies such as gradual exposure to social situations, practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it\u2019s okay to seek help along the way."

Although, some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior (i.e. they only do it when they are drinking, they only do it when they are mad), it\u2019s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation.

Start with smaller gatherings or settings where you have a support system, and gradually increase your exposure as you feel ready.\n\n6. **Connect with Like-Minded Individuals**: Finding communities or groups that share your interests (for example, animal lovers) can help create a more comfortable environment for social interaction.\n\n7. **Foster Connections with Animals**: Since you mentioned you prefer animals, consider spending time with them as a source of comfort. Volunteering at a shelter or fostering pets can provide fulfilling interactions without the stress of human socializing.\n\n8. **Establish Routine and Structure**: Creating a daily routine can help you feel more grounded and reduce anxiety. Include activities that bring you joy, relaxation, and a sense of accomplishment.\n\nRemember, it's okay to reach out for help and there are ways to navigate your feelings.

Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown. \u00a0Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety.\u00a0Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die.\u00a0Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep.

Many people struggle with concepts of eternity, whether it\u2019s comforting or frightening.

The concept of forever may seem unfathomable, and the pressure to find meaning or purpose in an unending life can be daunting. In some cases, it may feel like an escape from the finite experiences we have here on Earth, which can add to the anxiety.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you process these feelings:\n\n1. **Talk About It**: Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust\u2014be it a friend, family member, or a mental health professional\u2014can provide relief. They might offer perspectives you hadn\u2019t considered.\n\n2. **Grounding Techniques**: When you find yourself overwhelmed, grounding techniques can help bring your focus back to the present moment. Practices like deep breathing, mindfulness, or focusing on your surroundings can be effective.\n\n3. **Explore Your Beliefs**: If you feel comfortable, exploring your beliefs can lead to a deeper understanding of your feelings. This might involve reading about different perspectives on life after death or discussing your thoughts with someone knowledgeable in your faith or a different philosophy.\n\n4. **Acceptance**: It may help to acknowledge that it\u2019s normal to have these thoughts and that it\u2019s okay to not have all the answers. Embracing uncertainty can sometimes alleviate anxiety.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Help**: If your thoughts are leading to significant anxiety or panic, consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can provide strategies and support tailored to your needs.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s completely normal to have these thoughts, and taking steps to address them is a positive move.

There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional,\u00a0your continued \u00a0dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that \u00a0that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This is\u00a0YOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are\u00a0incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we\u00a0 are feeling anxious.

It sounds really difficult to deal with recurrent nightmares and the anxiety that can come with them. Poor sleep can affect both your physical and mental health, so it's important to address these issues.\n\nHere are a few suggestions that might help you:\n\n1. **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Establish a calming routine before bed to help signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could include activities such as reading, listening to soothing music, or practicing deep breathing exercises.\n\n2. **Limit Screen Time:** Try to avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least an hour before bed, as the blue light emitted can interfere with your ability to fall asleep.\n\n3. **Keep a Dream Journal:** Writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up can help you process them. Sometimes, understanding or reflecting on the content can lessen their grip on you.\n\n4. **Talk to Someone:** It might help to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. They can provide support and guidance in coping with your dreams and anxiety around sleep.\n\n5. **Practice Relaxation Techniques:** Techniques such as meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality.\n\n6. **Consider Professional Help:** If nightmares persist and significantly affect your life, a therapist who specializes in sleep disorders or trauma may be beneficial. They can help you explore strategies tailored to your needs.\n\n7. **Evaluate Sleep Environment:** Make sure your sleeping environment is conducive to rest. This includes a comfortable mattress, a dark and quiet room, and a slightly cool temperature.\n\nSleep is an essential part of well-being, and taking steps to address these issues can significantly improve your quality of life. If you're experiencing ongoing sleep disturbances, seeking professional help is an important step."

This is really a tough new challenge. I just want to break up with him, but I love him so much. I don\u2019t know why he is acting this way lately. I believe I have separation anxiety.

Have you talked with your boyfriend about this struggle you're feeling? It can be hard to have this kind of conversation without triggering a sense of blame and subsequent defensiveness in our partners, but it really is possible. If you have any concerns about being able to do this, then a session or two with a local counselor or therapist might be really helpful - and it really can be just about finding the way to share what you're feeling.As far as coping with anxiety, there are a lot of options but I highly recommend an app called Self-Help for Anxiety Management. There's so much good information in this app to help you learn to pay attention to what kinds of thoughts are helpful or unhelpful, and there are also lots of activities for calming down and decreasing the intensity of that anxiety.

I then start to act weird because I'm trying to fight my paranoia. This leads to people starring at me because they don't know that I'm suffering from panic attacks and paranoia. They just notice me acting scared around kids and they think I'm a threat because of it.    I'm not a pervert or predator. I would never hurt a kid.

Many people face various forms of anxiety, and it's commendable that you want to understand and address it.\n\nHere are some suggestions to help you cope with your feelings:\n\n1. **Recognize Your Feelings**: It's important to acknowledge and accept how you're feeling without judgment.

These include focusing on your surroundings, taking deep breaths, or using sensory distractions (e.g., carrying a small object to focus on).\n\n4. **Slow Exposure**: Gradually exposing yourself to situations that make you anxious can be beneficial. Start with less intense situations involving kids and slowly build up your comfort level.\n\n5. **Educate Yourself**: Sometimes, understanding why you feel a certain way can help alleviate some of your fears.

That is a big deal, and please try not to take it lightly! When we get burnt out, I have found that it's from one of two things: either we are not doing what we want, or we are doing too much (either of something we want or something we don't, doesn't really matter once we get into doing too much.)If either of those rings true for your experience, try as much as possible to sit with the experience and get a better sense of where the burn out is coming from.

We would build a hierarchy of fears, that is a list of fears ranging from least to most, for example the man may want to start by looking at a picture of a bridge while employing his relation technique, then he may want to see a real bridge from a distance while employing that same relaxation technique, then moving closer to the bridge, then maybe standing on a bridge, all the while moving closer to his fear while relaxing, until you come to most fearful proposition which is crossing that bridge, or you can also engage in flooding which is for example, if you were scared of an elevator, go into an elevator until you are not panicking anymore, in the movie Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne who has a great fear of bats, goes into this cave and allows himself to be surrounded by bats until he is no longer fearful of them. Secondly, look at your fears, do they even need to be worked on, some fears are healthy, for example if i was a therapist in New York City and someone came to me and said \"I'm scared of snakes\", I would probably say that is OK because there are very little snakes left in ManhattanHope that helps C",

It\u2019s important to recognize that having a healthy sexual relationship can be safe and fulfilling when precautions are taken. Here are some steps you might consider to help address your fears and improve your comfort level:\n\n1. **Open Communication**: Talk to your partner about your feelings and fears. It\u2019s important that both of you understand each other's perspectives and work together to find a solution. Your partner should be aware of your concerns and can help reassure you.\n\n2. **Education**: Sometimes, fear stems from a lack of information. Educate yourself about safe sex practices, STIs, and contraception. Knowing that you are taking precautions and understanding the risks can help alleviate some of your anxiety.\n\n3. **Gradual Approach**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider taking a gradual approach. Start with intimate moments that don\u2019t involve penetrative sex, such as cuddling or kissing. This can help build intimacy and comfort without the pressure.\n\n4. **Consult a Professional**: If your anxiety feels unmanageable, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in sexual health or relationships. They can help you work through your fears and develop coping strategies.\n\n5. **Focus on Consent**: Make sure that both you and your partner feel comfortable and consent to any sexual activity. This mutual understanding can help create a safer emotional space for both of you.\n\n6. **Reassess Your Comfort Level**: Take time to assess what specifically makes you feel scared and whether those fears are based on facts or assumptions. Addressing specific fears can be beneficial.\n\n7. **Consider Your Partner\u2019s Needs**: While it's important to address your own fears, consider your partner's feelings and desires too. Finding a balance where both partners feel satisfied and respected is crucial.\n\nUltimately, prioritizing communication and comfort can go a long way in building a healthy sexual relationship. Don't hesitate to seek help if you need it, and remember that it's okay to take things at your own pace."

Sleep problems, including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about, are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changed\u00a0or started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication, talk to your provider about the nightmares, this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense, but then again even good dreams don't always make much sense. Ask yourself, do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work, school, relationships, health.... all of these areas\u00a0and many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up \"Guided Meditation for Sleep\" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are self-help ideas for managing bad nightmares.

It means they\nwon\u2019t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or\ncoercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. \u00a0Your personal safety and mental well-being is\nwhat is most important. \nNow, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM\nand may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you\ncan explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles\nare better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. \nMany people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but\nagain, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is\nalso important to know that BDSM is not\u00a0just one thing and people practice it\ndifferently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with,\nthen you shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to do it.\n\u00a0\nI hope this was helpful. Be well.\n\u00a0\nRobin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",
        "Generated": "It's completely understandable to feel anxious about your relationship, especially when it involves topics that you're not sure about, like BDSM. Communication is key in any relationship, especially when it comes to desires and boundaries. Here are a few steps you might consider:\n\n1. **Open Communication**: Talk to your boyfriend about your feelings and anxieties. Be honest about how his interest in BDSM makes you feel and express your concerns. A healthy relationship should allow for open discussions about comfort levels and boundaries.\n\n2. **Set Boundaries**: Discuss what you are comfortable with and what you are not. It's important to establish clear boundaries, especially with BDSM, where consent and communication are crucial.\n\n3. **Educate Yourself**: Learning more about BDSM might help alleviate some of your fears. Understanding the principles of safe, sane, and consensual practices can provide a framework for a healthy exploration of interests.\n\n4. **Take Your Time**: If you decide you want to explore BDSM, take it slow. There\u2019s no rush, and you should only proceed if you feel completely comfortable.\n\n5. **Trust Your Instincts**: If you have a strong feeling that something is wrong, trust your instincts. Your comfort and safety should always come first in any relationship.\n\n6. **Seek Support**: If your anxiety becomes overwhelming, consider talking to a mental health professional. They can help you work through your feelings and provide support.\n\nUltimately, your comfort and emotional safety must be a priority. It's important to ensure that both you and your boyfriend share the same understanding and respect for each other's boundaries."

        "Human": "This is a very common question in my practice. Panic attacks typically emerge from an underlying issue (ex. Depression, low self-esteem, fears). To decrease your anxiety symptoms it\u2019s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: \"I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed\". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful. Keep in mind, a therapist can help with guiding you through self relaxation and improvement.",

I still know that it's the same one, and then I wake up in a panic, and I cry really loud without knowing the reason. Why do I see the same dream, why can I not remember it, and what should I do to remember it?",

One thing you might try, to see if you can get more insight into the dream and possibly begin remembering things, is to take note of whatever you do remember, any details about your experience, such as when do you wake up from the dream, how do you feel, both emotionally and physically, what are you thinking about when you wake up, is there any pattern in terms of what happens to you in your waking life around the time you have this dream... If you can keep a journal or a recording device to speak into by your bed, you can try to record whatever you do remember and notice as soon as you wake up.

Here are some insights into why this might be happening and what you can do to try to remember it:\n\n1. **Unresolved Emotions or Experiences**: Recurring dreams often indicate that there are unresolved feelings, anxieties, or experiences in your life. The dream might be your mind's way of processing something that is difficult for you to confront.\n\n2. **Memory and Sleep**: Sometimes, dreams are not well-remembered due to how and when you wake up. Waking up suddenly or during a deep sleep phase can impact your ability to recall dreams. The intensity of emotions might cause you to wake in a state of panic, overshadowing the details of the dream itself.\n\n3. **Symbolism**: Dreams often operate on a symbolic level. Even if you can't remember the details, the feelings associated with the dream can provide clues about what it might represent in your waking life.\n\n### What You Can Do:\n\n1. **Keep a Dream Journal**: As soon as you wake up, write down anything you can remember about the dream, even if it's just a feeling or a fragment. Over time, you might start to recall more details. \n\n2. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Consider what you were thinking or feeling leading up to the dream. Sometimes, insights into your waking life can help you connect the dots.\n\n3. **Relaxation Techniques**: Since your dream causes panic and crying, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness before bed can help create a calmer environment for sleep.\n\n4. **Talk About It**: Discuss your dreams and feelings with someone you trust, like a friend or family member. Sometimes, verbalizing emotions can provide clarity.\n\n5. **Consult a Professional**: If the recurring dream and the panic it's causing are significantly distressing, it might be beneficial to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore any underlying issues.\n\n6. **Create a Bedtime Routine**: Establishing a calm and consistent nighttime routine can help you relax and make your sleep more restful, which may facilitate better dream recall.\n\nRemember, it's normal for dreams to be elusive, and exploring these feelings in a safe way can help you find the answers or closure you might be seeking."

This could stem from various factors\u2014emotional, psychological, or even situational. Here are some potential reasons and considerations:\n\n1. **Emotional Release**: Sometimes, the urge to declutter can be linked to a need for emotional control or a desire to create a more peaceful environment. If there are underlying emotional issues or stressors in your life, this may manifest as a compulsion to throw things away.\n\n2. **Attachment to Memories**: Objects often hold sentimental value, and the need to get rid of them might be tied to how you process memories or changes in your life. Reflecting on why certain items are significant to you may help clarify your feelings.\n\n3. **Coping Mechanism**: For some, decluttering can serve as a coping mechanism to gain control in situations where they feel overwhelmed. It might help to identify other ways of managing stress or anxiety that don\u2019t revolve around physical belongings.\n\n4. **Fear of Hoarding or Clutter**: If you\u2019ve had experiences in the past that involved clutter or hoarding, it\u2019s possible that you\u2019re developing a heightened sensitivity to the presence of belongings.\n\n5. **Minimalism or Lifestyle Changes**: If you've been influenced by minimalism or lived in spaces that encourage decluttering, it may lead to increased pressure to conform to that lifestyle, resulting in anxiety when you feel you have too much.\n\n6. **Routine or Habit**: This behavior may have developed as a habit, and habits can be hard to break. Establishing a new routine that does not involve compulsively decluttering might be beneficial.\n\n**Suggestions for Coping:**\n\n1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Journaling your thoughts and feelings around your belongings can help you understand the root of your anxiety.\n\n2. **Set Boundaries**: Consider setting specific times or limits for decluttering. This can help manage the urge while allowing you to address it in a structured way.\n\n3. **Talk It Out**: Speaking with a therapist or counselor could help you explore the underlying causes of your anxiety and develop strategies to cope with it.\n\n4. **Mindfulness Techniques**: Engaging in mindfulness or relaxation exercises might help reduce anxiety and shift your focus away from your belongings.\n\n5. **Create a \u201cDecision Box\u201d**: If you feel the urge to throw something away, put it in a box first. Set a time later to review it. This might help delay the decision and reduce anxiety.\n\n6. **Focus on Purpose**: Instead of focusing on getting rid of things, try to shift the focus to the purpose they serve in your life. This might help you appreciate what you have rather than feeling overwhelmed by it.\n\nRemember, it\u2019s okay to seek help and explore these feelings further. Understanding the root causes of your anxiety can be a critical step in finding peace with your belongings."

        "Human": "Hi Biddeford,This is a super goal. Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens.\u00a0Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now\", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say \"let's get you dressed\", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try \"as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack\". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it.\u00a0Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!",
        "Generated": "It can be quite challenging when toddlers assert their independence, and it\u2019s normal to feel the need for control as a parent. Here are some strategies to help you shift your approach while still guiding your toddler:\n\n1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Instead of feeling the need to control everything, establish a few clear and consistent boundaries. This gives your child a safe framework within which she can assert her independence.\n\n2. **Offer Choices**: Give your toddler a sense of control by offering choices within limits. For example, you can say, \u201cWould you like to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?\u201d This allows her to feel empowered while still guiding her.\n\n3. **Pick Your Battles**: Focus on what truly matters to you and let go of less important issues. This not only reduces your need for control but also makes the important boundaries more meaningful.\n\n4. **Positive Reinforcement**: When your toddler follows directions or makes good choices, reinforce that behavior with praise or rewards. This encourages her to respond positively to your requests.\n\n5. **Model Calmness**: Stay calm and composed in the face of defiance. Children often mirror their parents\u2019 emotions. If you remain calm, it may help her regulate her own reactions.\n\n6. **Use Redirecting**: If she says no, try redirecting her attention to something else. For example, if she refuses to eat a certain vegetable, you might say, \u201cLet\u2019s make a funny face with our food! How about we pretend this carrot is a nose?\u201d\n\n7. **Empathy and Understanding**: Validate her feelings. If she says no, try saying, \u201cI understand you don\u2019t want to do that right now. It can be hard to stop playing.\u201d This shows her that you are listening and acknowledging her emotions.\n\n8. **Teach Problem-Solving**: When appropriate, involve her in solving problems instead of issuing commands. Ask her what she thinks should happen next, which can foster her autonomy while keeping her engaged.\n\n9. **Set a Routine**: Having a consistent daily routine can help your toddler know what to expect and feel secure, which may reduce her impulses to resist.\n\n10. **Practice Self-Care**: Take time for yourself to recharge, as parenting can be exhausting. When you feel more balanced, you may find it easier to let go of the need for control.\n\n11. **Connect Before You Direct**: Spend a few moments connecting with your toddler before asking her to follow a direction. A short game or silly song can set a positive tone and make her more receptive.\n\n12. **Reflect on Control**: Spend some time reflecting on your desire for control. Consider what is driving it and whether it stems from fear, anxiety, or external pressures. Recognizing these emotions can help you let go.\n\nRemember, toddlers are in a stage of testing boundaries and seeking independence. Patience and understanding can go a long way in creating a trusting and responsive relationship between you and your child."

The problem is that I panic and experience anxiety and depression thinking of him with someone else and then thinking I will never meet someone I like.

Consider everything from daily communication to shared experiences and long-term goals. This clarity might help reinforce your feelings about the relationship.\n\n2. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's natural to feel anxiety and depression at the thought of separating from someone you\u2019ve been with for a long time, especially with concerns about loneliness or not finding someone else. Allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment, and remind yourself that they are temporary.\n\n3. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends or a therapist about your feelings. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can help you process your emotions more clearly and provide the support you need to make the best choice for yourself.\n\n4. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques such as meditation or deep-breathing exercises can help manage your anxiety and stay grounded in the present moment. This might make it easier to cope with the feelings that arise as you consider ending the relationship.\n\n5. **Prepare for the Transition**: If you decide to end things, think about practical steps to make the transition smoother. This may involve planning how to communicate your decision, setting boundaries, and creating a support system for yourself during the change.\n\n6. **Give Yourself Time**: After ending a long-term relationship, it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel a range of emotions, including grief and uncertainty about the future. Allow yourself time to heal and rediscover what you want for yourself before jumping into something new.\n\n7. **Consider the Long-Term**: Remind yourself that staying in a relationship that doesn\u2019t meet your needs can hinder your chance of finding the companionship and presence you truly desire. Ending it may open the door to healthier relationships in the future.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s important to honor your needs and desires for a fulfilling relationship.

Children no longer need the basics (food, shelter. water, safety) as much as when they were toddlers, but rather, their needs shift to wanting more support, encouragement, advice, and room to make mistakes.

That requires the two adults to act like adults with each other for the sake of their child.What's confusing for children is seeing their parents act uncivilly or manipulatively. Children also do well with routines so regular dependable visitation is preferable to random visitation or, worse, not following through on commitments.But if one person is exploiting their child to harm their ex-partner, then visiting your child in that context may be stressful to him/her (depending on what you mean by using your child as a pawn). When dealing with a hostile ex-partner, your first challenge is to negotiate rules and boundaries with your ex-partner about appropriate behavior for the good of your child. If you cannot come to an agreement, a counselor can help mediate a conversation.

Frequent and positive interactions can offer love and stability, but it's crucial to consider how those interactions are framed by your ex. If seeing your child too frequently leads to conflict or manipulation from your ex, it might complicate things for both you and your child.\n\n3. **Establish Boundaries**: Set clear boundaries with your ex-wife about your role as a parent. Having clear communication and a structured parenting plan can reduce confusion and ensure that your child knows they are loved by both parents.\n\n4. **Quality Over Quantity**: It may be more beneficial to focus on quality time spent with your child rather than the frequency of visits. When you do see your child, make those moments count by being fully present, engaging in activities they enjoy, and fostering a nurturing relationship.\n\n5. **Keep Communication Open**: Depending on their age, maintain an open line of communication with your child. Let them know you care about them, and encourage them to express their feelings about the situation. \n\n6. **Seek Support**: This journey can be emotionally taxing. Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can help you process your feelings and provide strategies to cope with the situation.

Building a fulfilling life outside of this relationship can help in healing and moving forward.\n\n8. **Legal Considerations**: If you believe your ex-wife is using the child as a pawn, it may be advisable to consult with a legal professional regarding custody and visitation rights to ensure that your relationship with your child is protected.\n\nUltimately, the decision about how much to see your child should be based on what's healthiest for you both.

It\u2019s important to approach your son calmly to avoid escalating tensions. Try to understand why he felt the need to steal your debit card. Sometimes, underlying issues like peer pressure, self-esteem issues, or emotional struggles can lead to such behavior.\n\n2. **Open a Dialogue**: Have a candid conversation with him about the incident. Instead of approaching it with anger or punishment, ask open-ended questions that encourage him to share his feelings. For example, \"Can you help me understand what made you take my card?\" Emphasize that it's safe for him to be honest with you.\n\n3. **Discuss Consequences**: It's important he understands the seriousness of his actions. Explain why stealing is wrong and discuss logical consequences related to the behavior\u2014like making amends for what he did. This could be through helping with chores, doing extra work around the house, or contributing to paying back any money spent.\n\n4. **Establish Trust and Boundaries**: Talk about the importance of honesty in your relationship. Set clear expectations regarding trust and boundaries going forward. You might want to consider involving him in developing a plan on how he can regain your trust.\n\n5. **Professional Support**: If this behavior continues, it may be helpful to seek guidance from a counselor or therapist. They can provide support for both you and your son and help him work through any underlying issues contributing to his behavior.\n\n6. **Model Honest Behavior**: Make sure that you are modeling the behavior you want to see. Demonstrating honesty and openness in your own communications and actions can inspire him to adopt the same values.\n\n7. **Monitor and Follow Up**: Give him a chance to show he can be responsible, and keep the lines of communication open. After some time, revisit the topic to see how he\u2019s feeling and discuss his progress regarding trust and honesty.\n\nRemember, building trust and teaching values take time and consistency.

Your child is likely overwhelmed and expressing extreme feelings, and it\u2019s important for you to provide a sense of safety and stability.\n\n2. **Talk to Her**: When she\u2019s calm, have a gentle conversation with her about what happened. Ask her about her feelings and let her know that it's okay to express difficult emotions. Try to understand what specifically made her feel that way.\n\n3. **Validate Her Emotions**: Let her know that it\u2019s okay to feel upset or tired. Validate her feelings by saying things like, \"I understand that you were really tired and frustrated.\"\n\n4. **Discuss the Baby**: If you think that the new sibling\u2019s arrival may be impacting her, talk about it. Explain that it\u2019s normal to feel various emotions when a new baby arrives, and reassure her that she is still loved and important.\n\n5. **Monitor for Future Incidents**: Keep an eye on her emotional well-being over the coming days and weeks. If you notice continued signs of distress, it may be beneficial to consult a professional, such as a pediatrician or child psychologist, who can provide guidance.\n\n6. **Establish a Routine**: Consistent routines can provide a sense of security for children. Make sure she has time for rest, play, and one-on-one time with you, even with the new baby.\n\n7. **Teach Coping Skills**: Help her to develop healthy coping strategies for her emotions. This can include deep breathing exercises, talking about her feelings, or engaging in calming activities.\n\n8. **Involve Family**: If appropriate, involve your child\u2019s grandparents in the conversation. They may be able to help support her and reassure her about her place in the family.\n\nIf she continues to express thoughts of self-harm or if you're feeling unsure about how to handle her emotions, don't hesitate to reach out to a mental health professional. It's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to emotional well-being."

I would recommend looking for a therapist/counselor who works with children/adolescents in the area of addressing trauma for an assessment. They may be able to ask the right questions to see whether trauma is truly the issue.",
        "Generated": "It sounds like you're facing a really tough situation, and it's understandable to feel frustrated. Managing an adolescent's relationship with food and body image can be challenging, especially when they are resistant to guidance. Here are some strategies that might help:\n\n1. **Open Communication**: Start by fostering an open and nonjudgmental dialogue about food, health, and self-image. Ask her how she feels about her body and what she thinks about food. Listen to her concerns without judgment.\n\n2. **Focus on Health, Not Weight**: Frame conversations around health and well-being rather than focusing on weight. Encourage her to engage in activities that promote health, such as cooking healthy meals together or finding fun ways to be active.\n\n3. **Model Healthy Behaviors**: Be sure you're modeling the behaviors you want to see. Show a positive attitude towards healthy eating and regular physical activity in your own life.\n\n4. **Involve Her in Decision-Making**: Allow her to have a say in meal planning and grocery shopping. This can help her feel more in control and make the process feel collaborative rather than imposed.\n\n5. **Educate Together**: Explore nutrition knowledge together. You might look at reputable resources or even consult a dietitian who specializes in adolescent health to provide guidance.\n\n6. **Set Realistic Goals**: Help her set achievable goals related to health and fitness that are specific, measurable, and enjoyable. Celebrate her progress, no matter how small.\n\n7. **Promote Self-Esteem**: Focus on activities that build her confidence outside of her appearance. Encourage her to pursue interests and hobbies that make her feel good about herself.\n\n8. **Seek Professional Help**: If the relationship with food continues to be problematic, consider involving a healthcare professional, such as a therapist or a registered dietitian, who can provide specialized support.\n\n9. **Establish Family Meals**: Try to have regular family meals where you can all enjoy healthy foods together. This can also serve as a time to bond and communicate.\n\n10. **Manage Expectations**: Understand that change takes time, and support her with patience and encouragement. Adolescent years can be turbulent, and being a consistent source of support can make a difference.\n\nIf her behavior escalates or if you're concerned about her mental health, it\u2019s essential to seek professional guidance. You're not alone in this, and getting help can make a significant difference for both her and the family."

        "Human": "I see a few issues here:First, the age of the child is important.\u00a0 If the child is considered an\n\"adult\" by state law with regard to counseling (states differ on this\n- the range is typically between age 13 and age 18), no one is allowed to\nbe in the session without the child's consent.Second, ethical and legal standards generally require that a\ncounselor be in the role of a therapist, or in the role of an evaluator, but\nnot both.\u00a0 This means that a counselor\nshould not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should\nhave custody of a child.Third, knowing the details of any parenting plan or\nseparation agreement is important.\u00a0\nGenerally, either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and\ncan be present during the child\u2019s sessions.\u00a0\nIf a court order, parenting plan, or separation agreement specifies that\none of the parents has sole decision making authority, then only that parent can\nconsent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child\u2019s\nsessions.In a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking\nout legal advice specific to your state law.",
        "Generated": "In most situations, a counselor should maintain neutrality and prioritize the best interests of the child. Taking sides with one parent or encouraging a child to disclose details about the other parent's visitation could be considered unethical and inappropriate. Counselors are typically bound by professional ethics, which emphasize the importance of confidentiality, neutrality, and the welfare of the child.\n\nIf a parent encourages a child to divulge details in order to build a case for custody, it raises concerns about the influence on the child and the potential for creating conflict between the parents. This behavior can be harmful to the child's well-being and may also violate legal or professional standards for counseling.\n\nIf there are custody disputes or concerns regarding a child's safety, it is advisable for parents to work through the legal system and seek appropriate professional guidance rather than using informal methods to gather information. Counselors can play a vital role in supporting the child's emotional needs, but their role should not be to advocate for one parent over the other."

        "Generated": "It sounds like you're dealing with a challenging situation. It's not uncommon for some adolescents to lose track of bodily sensations when they're deeply focused or engrossed in gaming or watching videos. Here are some suggestions you might find helpful:\n\n1. **Understand the Behavior**: Losing track of the need to use the bathroom can sometimes happen when someone is intensely focused. It may not necessarily be a defiant behavior; it can be an issue of awareness and self-regulation.\n\n2. **Set Reminders**: Encourage him to take regular breaks during his gaming or video-watching sessions. Setting a timer to remind him to get up and use the bathroom might help.\n\n3. **Establish a Routine**: Encourage a regular bathroom schedule. For instance, encourage him to use the bathroom at specific times throughout the day, such as before starting a gaming session or every couple of hours during longer sessions.\n\n4. **Communicate Openly**: Discuss the situation with him in a non-punitive manner. Ask how he feels during these instances and whether he realizes when he needs to go. Understanding his perspective is crucial for finding solutions.\n\n5. **Evaluate Triggers**: Besides gaming, assess if there are other triggers leading to this behavior. Stress, anxiety, or changes in routine might also contribute.\n\n6. **Consult a Professional**: If the behavior persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional or a child psychologist. They can help assess if there are underlying issues, such as anxiety or other developmental concerns, that need to be addressed.\n\n7. **Positive Reinforcement**: Rather than focusing on punishment, consider positive reinforcement for successful bathroom use during gaming sessions. Celebrate small victories to encourage better habits.\n\n8. **Limit Game Time**: While it may not be ideal in the moment, limiting screen time may help him develop better habits over time and recognize the importance of taking breaks.\n\nIt's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, as it can be distressing for both you and him. Finding the right balance of guidance, support, and professional help can lead to improvements over time."

        "Human": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn't usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don't have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn't necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive.\u00a0 When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again.\u00a0That\u00a0you\u00a0have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn't\u00a0usually\u00a0help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone's guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor.

Allow yourself to feel your emotions, but also consider seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional who can help you process these feelings.

We argued a lot, and due to that, there was a lot of tension between us. We stayed together because we love each other and wanted to make it work. I used to party a lot, and several times I got into situations where I would end up kissing someone else. These situations were never more than just kissing. I have come clean about these situations with my boyfriend, and he decided to forgive and move forward with me. I love him so much and want to work things out too, but I'm having a difficult time understanding how he can forgive me. I can't seem to forgive myself. I'm overwhelmed with feelings of guilt and unworthiness.",
        "Human": "Hi Cerritos,This is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions.\u00a0My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound.\u00a0If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesn't mean \"it was okay\"; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore.\u00a0You have done many things here that you can feel proud of! You've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honourably. It's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. It's not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...it's how we handle them afterwards.I wish you growth and happiness.",
        "Generated": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by guilt and unworthiness, especially after experiencing conflicts and breaches of trust in your relationship. Here are some thoughts that might help you navigate through these feelings and work towards healing:\n\n1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to allow yourself to feel the guilt and acknowledge it, but also recognize that these feelings are not necessarily indicative of your worth. Understand that everyone makes mistakes and that growth often comes from learning from them.\n\n2. **Understand His Perspective**: Your boyfriend's decision to forgive you could stem from a deep love and commitment to the relationship. He may see the value in the relationship you both have built over the years and believe that your connection is worth fighting for.\n\n3. **Communicate Openly**: Have an open conversation with your boyfriend about how you\u2019re feeling. Sharing your feelings of guilt and unworthiness can help him understand what you're going through and strengthen your emotional connection. It's also an opportunity to discuss how both of you envision your future together and ways to rebuild trust.\n\n4. **Focus on Growth**: Reflect on what you've learned from these experiences. How have they changed your outlook on relationships? What positive changes have you made since then? Focusing on personal growth can help you feel more positive about yourself and the relationship.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Help**: Sometimes, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide an external perspective and help you work through feelings of guilt and self-worth. They can also offer strategies for repairing your relationship.\n\n6. **Rebuild Trust**: Take tangible steps to rebuild trust with your boyfriend. This could involve being more transparent about your social interactions, ensuring open communication, and demonstrating a commitment to the relationship.\n\n7. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that it\u2019s okay to be imperfect and that forgiveness, both from others and yourself, is a process. Engage in self-care activities and surround yourself with supportive friends and family.\n\n8. **Create Shared Goals**: Work together with your boyfriend to set shared goals for your relationship, focusing on what you both want for the future. This can help re-establish a sense of unity and purpose.\n\nHealing takes time, and it\u2019s perfectly okay to seek support as you work through these feelings. Remember, relationships can be complex, and the path to forgiveness and healing often involves ups and downs. Be patient with yourself and your partner as you navigate this process together."

Networking can sometimes open doors that applying online cannot.\n\n7. **Self-Care**: Taking care of your mental and physical health is essential.

Keeping a gratitude journal could help with this.\n\n9. **Talk to Your Dad**: If you feel comfortable, discuss your feelings with your dad.

Keep an open mind about where opportunities might show up.\n\nIt's understandable to feel overwhelmed, but remember that many people go through challenging phases in their lives.

He helped me financially after our break up by lending me $3000, so I'm grateful for that. I still hate him for what he did and still want him to like me although we're not even talking anymore. We follow each other on Instagram and that's it. I feel like I still need his validation. This is haunting me day and night.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of conflicting emotions, and that's completely normal after a painful breakup, especially one involving betrayal. Here are some thoughts that might help you as you navigate this tough time:\n\n1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to acknowledge and validate your feelings, whether it's anger, sadness, confusion, or even lingering affection. All these emotions are part of the healing process. Allow yourself to feel them without judgment.\n\n2. **Reflect on the Past**: Consider how your past experiences, including your father's alcoholism and infidelity, may have shaped your views and emotions about trust and relationships. Understanding the roots of your low self-esteem can be a crucial step in breaking the cycle of unhealthy patterns. \n\n3. **Set Boundaries**: If checking your ex-boyfriend's social media is causing you distress, it might be helpful to take a break from it. You can mute or unfollow him for a while. Focusing on your own life and progress can help reduce the emotional turmoil.\n\n4. **Forgiveness, for Yourself**: Forgiveness doesn\u2019t mean condoning what he did; it\u2019s more about freeing yourself from the weight of anger and betrayal. You deserve to move forward and create space for healing. Think of forgiveness as a gift you give yourself, not him.\n\n5. **Seek Support**: Talking to a therapist or a counselor can provide you with tools to process your feelings and gain perspective. Support from friends or support groups can also be invaluable.\n\n6. **Focus on Self-Improvement**: Dedicate time to your personal goals, interests, and hobbies. Building your self-esteem and self-worth independently can help you gain a stronger sense of who you are outside of your relationships.\n\n7. **Give Yourself Time**: Healing takes time, and it\u2019s okay if you\u2019re not over things just yet. Be gentle with yourself and acknowledge that it\u2019s a process. Patience is key.\n\n8. **Consider New Relationships Cautiously**: While it\u2019s great that you want to focus on a new relationship, ensure that you are not bringing unresolved issues into it. Take time to heal before diving into something new.\n\nDealing with the aftermath of betrayal, especially with your background and experiences, can be extremely difficult. Remember that seeking help and taking active steps toward healing is a sign of strength. You\u2019re taking the right steps by recognizing your feelings and wanting to move forward."

Mixed signals can arise from his internal conflict about the desire for freedom while still being tied to you.\n\nIn situations like this, it can be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional or a support group.

        "Generated": "Deciding whether to give your fianc\u00e9 another chance is a deeply personal decision and depends on several factors. Here are some things to consider:\n\n1. **Trust Issues**: Cheating can severely damage trust. Can you see a path to rebuilding that trust? It's important to assess whether you believe he can genuinely change and if he's willing to put in the work to repair the relationship.\n\n2. **Communication**: Have you both addressed the underlying issues and miscommunications that contributed to the cheating? Open and honest communication is crucial for moving forward.\n\n3. **Personal Reflection**: Examine your feelings for him. Do you still love him, or are you holding onto the relationship out of habit or fear of being alone? \n\n4. **Boundaries and Needs**: Consider what you need from him to feel secure and happy in a relationship. Are those needs realistic, and is he willing and able to meet them?\n\n5. **Patterns of Behavior**: Think about the reasons behind the cheating. If he has cheated multiple times, what is different now? Is he showing genuine remorse and a willingness to change?\n\n6. **Counseling**: Sometimes, having a neutral third party, like a counselor, can help both partners communicate better and work through their issues.\n\nTake your time to weigh these factors, and trust your instincts. If you're leaning toward giving him another chance, it may be helpful to set clear boundaries and terms for the relationship moving forward. However, if you feel that the relationship is causing you more pain than joy, it might be best to prioritize your own well-being."

        "Generated": "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult time. It can be really painful when family members don't support us in the way we expect, especially during challenging situations like a divorce. Your sister's decision not to defend you might stem from her own feelings about the situation, her desire to avoid conflict, or perhaps a belief that she's trying to remain neutral. It's also possible she didn\u2019t fully understand the extent of the issues at play.\n\nIt's understandable to feel hurt or frustrated by her reactions. Clear communication with her about how her response made you feel might help clarify things. However, it's also important to consider that she may be trying to avoid taking sides, which can be complicated in family dynamics. Focus on healing for yourself, and remember that it\u2019s okay to set boundaries with people who aren\u2019t supporting you as you need."
