Maybe read some of the ones which state that no person is worthless, and that everyone has a good purpose to their life.Also, since our culture is so saturated with the belief that if someone doesn't feel good about themselves that this is somehow terrible.Bad feelings are part of living. They are the motivation to remove ourselves from situations and relationships which do us more harm than good.Bad feelings do feel terrible. Your feeling of worthlessness may be good in the sense of motivating you to find out that you are much better than your feelings today.",

In fact, most people who come to see me for counselling have more than one issue they would like to work on in psychotherapy and most times these are all interconnected. In counselling, we work together, collaboratively, to figure out which issues you would like to address first and then together we develop an individualized plan of care. Basically, it’s like a road map of where you want to go, how are you going to get there, looking at stopovers, some scenic routes others possibly not so scenic, however, necessary. Of course, these plans can also change due to internal (what we have control over like our thoughts, feelings and behaviours) or external reasons (those things that are outside our control). I would encourage you to take the next step and reach out to a professional you can trust and build rapport with by co-journeying through whatever concerns you have by examining what has been working so far as you have learned to cope with some of your issues like insomnia, depression and anxiety, as well as being a breast cancer survivor. Then to help you by developing new coping strategies. Psychotherapy can be such a powerful tool to help you get to where it is you want to be. I know you can do it and you will see first-hand how psychotherapy will help you to move past these points in your life where you are feeling stuck. I like to quote Nike where their motto is, “just do it.” You can do it.",

Many people have multiple areas in their lives that they want to work on, and a skilled therapist can help you address them all in a supportive way. You definitely do not have \"too many issues\" for counseling. In fact, a trained mental health professional is often equipped to help individuals navigate complex histories and multiple challenges. They can help you prioritize your concerns, explore underlying issues, and develop coping strategies tailored to your needs. It's important to remember that addressing past trauma, health issues, and mental health challenges is a process.

When a person cuts or uses other forms of self harm, the body produces endorphins to help make a person feel better. If a person was dealing with depression or high anxiety, that might be misinterpreted by the brain as a way to help oneself feel better and a new neural network or map might form (addiction) that would utilize this new behavior. Another way to look at it would be thru a behavioral lens, a positive reward for a behavior, even though the behavior has other long term negative consequences. Consider working with someone who can both have you work on and address those items that trigger your behavior and the root causes, in this case sadness or depression, and second find someone who can help give you alternatives that take into account the neurological requirement by replacing the behavior with another behavior (such as snapping a rubber band on the wrist) and working to extinguish the unwanted behavior.

Some housing providers may confuse ESAs with service animals, which have different regulations. 3. **Communicate with Your Apartment Manager**: Schedule a meeting with your apartment manager to discuss your situation further. Bring along your ESA documentation, and be prepared to explain your need for the animal. Sometimes a face-to-face discussion can clarify misunderstandings. 4. **Seek Legal Help**: If the situation isn't resolved through communication, consider consulting with a legal expert who specializes in tenant rights or disability rights. They can provide guidance and may help advocate for your rights. 5. **Contact Local Support Organizations**: Look for local tenants' rights organizations or mental health advocacy groups. They may offer resources or support in dealing with your apartment management. 6. **Consider Alternatives**: If you continue to face resistance and cannot keep the emotional support dog, you might explore whether other housing options are available to you that are more accommodating to emotional support animals. 7. **Document Everything**: Keep records of your communications with the apartment management and any actions taken regarding the situation. This documentation may be useful if you need to pursue further action. Remember to take care of your mental health during this process, and reach out to your support network for assistance.",

Chances are there are things that BOTH of you do that hurts your communication. Overall, try to talk to him directly and try not to get defensive. If he continues to say, you're always sad - then stay calm, say \"okay, can you help me understand that more?\" or \"That's interesting.

The lack of emotional support is definitely stressful.Your parenting skills may still be at the level at which they were prior to the divorce.Take your emotional weariness seriously and reflect on the various ways of stress relief which are available and interest you.Give yourself extra time to rest, nurture yourself and be flexible in finding what feels right for stabilizing yourself.Since you talk about your daughter and help in physical ways, if it is a matter of strength that you need, talk with your attorney so that the child custody agreement includes whatever is physically necessary in the way of strength, in taking care of your daughter.The Courts are very good at making effort that the custody agreement offers proper care to the kids.",

Here are some steps and strategies that might help you navigate through this period: ### Seek Professional Support 1. **Therapy or Counseling**: A therapist can provide you with valuable tools to cope with your emotions, manage stress, and improve your mental well-being. They can also help you process the feelings that arise during the divorce and navigate co-parenting challenges. 2. **Support Groups**: Consider joining a support group for those going through divorce or for single parents. Connecting with others who understand your experience can provide comfort and practical advice. ### Focus on Self-Care 1. **Establish Routine**: Building a daily routine can provide a sense of stability. Include time for self-care, even if it’s just a few minutes each day to do something you enjoy or find relaxing. 2. **Physical Activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve your mood. Even short walks or gentle yoga can make a difference. 3. **Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or mindfulness can help ground you in the present moment and reduce feelings of overwhelm. ### Connect with Your Daughter 1. **Quality Time**: Try to spend quality time with your daughter doing activities you both enjoy. This can strengthen your relationship and provide emotional support for both of you. 2. **Open Communication**: Encourage open and honest communication with your daughter. Let her know how you’re feeling and encourage her to share her own feelings. ### Practical Support 1. **Explore Local Resources**: Look into community resources such as local nonprofits, churches, or organizations that offer support to single parents. They might have programs or resources that can help you. 2. **Co-Parenting Strategies**: If possible, consider seeking a mediator or co-parenting counselor to facilitate more constructive communication with your ex-husband regarding your daughter. 3. **Childcare Solutions**: Look into local childcare options or after-school programs that might ease your load. ### Focus on the Future 1. **Set Small Goals**: Break down your goals into small, achievable steps. This could be as simple as organizing a space in your home or exploring new hobbies. 2. **Plan for Change**: Think about your long-term goals and what steps you need to take to achieve them, whether that’s in your personal life or professional path. ### Consider Taking Action 1. **Explore New Interests**: Engage in new hobbies or interests that you’ve always wanted to try. This can provide a sense of accomplishment and help shift your focus positively. 2. **Volunteer**: Helping others can also help you feel better about your own situation. Look for local volunteer opportunities to meet new people and uplift your spirits. ### Remember It's important to acknowledge your feelings and give yourself grace during this difficult time. Healing and adjustment take time, so be patient with yourself. If you find that your feelings of sadness and depression persist or worsen, please reach out to a mental health professional for support. You’re not alone in this, and reaching out for assistance is a strong step towards a better future for you and your daughter.",

        "text": "If you are a people-pleaser type or a natural caretaker, you can slowly \"lose yourself\" over time if you are always tending to the needs of others and neglecting yourself. If this sounds like a familiar pattern for you, this may have happened without you even realizing it if you were raised in a family where you had to pick up the slack alot. Maybe your parents were addicts or they might have even just worked all the time and you learned to \"take care of everything\" because that is what you had to do to help the family run smoothly. Over time, a person who grows up in this type of environment learns that you put the needs of others before your own. You might also be stuck in these types of patterns in intimate relationships as well; if you completely give yourself over to your significant other and you don't create a life for yourself with your own interests and supportive friends, you are at risk of losing what is unique and amazing about you. If you grew up in a family where you learned this role out of survival or because it was needed to take care of your family, it's easy to re-create this in adult relationships.In both scenarios, if there is no awareness that this \"self sacrifice at the expense of others\" is going on, your identity is shaped around being a caretaker/enabler/people-pleaser and down the road it can lead to depression, low self esteem, and a confused sense of self. Basically, you spend so much time helping other people that you don't make time for yourself or create a life of fulfillment. Before you realize it, you have been living a life for others instead of yourself and you have no idea who YOU are. Supporting loved ones and friends is important and certainly admirable, but if you are always that person that rescues, those that rely on you begin to take advantage of you and they will suck you dry if you let them. In conclusion, learning to set boundaries with those in your life that are too needy becomes a really important part of the process when you begin to recognize that you are unhappy and unfulfilled in life. It sounds like you may be at that crossroads right now. Take one small step at at a time. Identify the worst offenders in your life that suck time and energy, and limit your contact and/or set some strong boundaries with those people so you can refocus and do some soul-searching. Meanwhile, engage in pleasurable activities with people you enjoy being with, get yourself outside in the fresh air, get some good sleep, and eat some nourishing food!",

Here are some steps you might consider that could help you gain perspective and find direction: 1. **Self-Reflection**: Take some time to reflect on your values, interests, and passions. Journaling can be a helpful way to explore your thoughts and feelings. Ask yourself questions like: What makes me happy? What do I enjoy doing? What are my strengths and weaknesses? 2. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of focusing on big accomplishments, try setting small, achievable goals. This can help you build momentum and feel a sense of progress. Start with daily or weekly goals that are realistic and manageable. 3. **Break Down Tasks**: If there's something specific you want to accomplish, break it down into smaller, actionable steps. This can make tasks feel less overwhelming and more attainable. 4. **Limit Distractions**: Identify what distractions are affecting your focus. Consider creating a structured daily routine that incorporates time for both work and downtime without distractions. 5. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends, family, or a mentor about how you’re feeling. Sometimes, opening up to others can provide new insights and perspectives. If it feels necessary, consider speaking with a mental health professional who can help you navigate these feelings. 6. **Explore New Interests**: Sometimes, trying something new can help spark motivation and interest. Consider taking up a new hobby, volunteering, or learning a new skill that excites you. 7. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques like meditation or mindfulness can help you stay present and reduce feelings of anxiety about the future. It can also increase your awareness of your thoughts and feelings. 8. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Remember that feeling stuck is a part of growth, and everyone goes through phases of uncertainty. Give yourself grace and remember that it’s okay to take your time to figure things out. 9. **Celebrate Achievements**: Take stock of what you have accomplished, no matter how small. Celebrate those victories and recognize the progress you’ve made, even if it feels minimal. 10. **Reassess Your Environment**: Sometimes our surroundings can impact our mindset. Consider if there are changes you can make in your environment that might help you feel more grounded and focused. It's okay to not have everything figured out. Take it one step at a time, and know that it's possible to regain clarity and move forward.",

Sometimes, what's best for a person is the hardest thing to do, and may be completely opposite of what YOU want.Addictions don't happen in a vacuum. If you've had any experience with addicts at all, then I'm sure you've heard the term \"enabler\". A lot of the times, when people think they're \"helping\", they're actually enabling the addict to continue their self-destructive behavior. Tough love and clear boundaries are needed in a lot of situations, but especially with addictions. Family and friends are often the biggest contributing factor to someone choosing to use/drink, continuing to do so, or relapsing back into it.You said she recently quit. You said she is depressed. She wants to move. When a person receives counseling for addictions, they are encouraged to make changes like this. They need to break the habit, and this means removing people from their lives at times. It means moving to new locations. Anything that may trigger a relapse needs to be identified and removed. Not only that, but the addict needs to do a lot of personal reflection to figure out WHY they use/drink in the first place, and not only break the physical addiction to it, but deal with whatever is the root cause that led them to use in the first place. She may need some time alone to figure out who she is as a person, time to make some decisions for herself and do what she needs to do to be healthy.Don't pressure her to stay. Let her have the freedom to do what she needs to do. If she stays, the decision needs to be hers and hers alone. It doesn't need to be made under pressure. That will only lead to resentment. Support her, but don't try to change her or make her do anything, especially for selfish reasons. Let her go. It sounds like she needs some time to focus on herself right now. It wouldn't be a bad idea for you to do the same.",

Here are some steps you can take to help her: 1. **Listen and Validate**: Let her share her feelings with you. Sometimes, just being there to listen can provide comfort. Validate her feelings and let her know that it's okay to feel the way she does. 2. **Encourage Professional Help**: Suggest that she might benefit from speaking with a therapist or counselor, especially since she is feeling depressed after quitting alcohol. Professional support can provide her with coping strategies and emotional support. 3. **Be Patient**: Recovery and adjusting to life without alcohol can be a long process. Be patient and give her the space she needs to navigate her feelings and challenges. 4. **Offer Activities**: Engage her in activities you can do together that promote well-being, such as going for walks, exploring new hobbies, or participating in group activities that don't involve alcohol. This can help her find joy in new experiences. 5. **Create a Supportive Environment**: If she’s comfortable, create an alcohol-free space at home where she feels safe and secure. Encourage a healthy lifestyle through good nutrition, sleep, and exercise. 6. **Talk About the Move**: If she’s considering moving, have an open conversation about it. Ask her what she’s hoping to achieve by moving, and discuss the potential benefits and downsides together. Help her weigh her options. 7. **Be There for Her**: Remind her that you care about her and want to support her through this journey. Express your feelings about wanting her to stay but be respectful of her choices. 8. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about the challenges of quitting alcohol and recovery processes. This understanding can help you be more empathetic and supportive. 9. **Encourage Healthy Coping Mechanisms**: Help her find healthier ways to cope with her feelings, such as journaling, art, or physical activities that can lift her mood. 10. **Be Open About Your Feelings**: Share your feelings about wanting her to stay and how important she is to you. This honesty can strengthen your connection. Ultimately, while you can provide support, it's important to respect her autonomy and the decisions she makes for herself.

Many people experience what is often called \"role conflict\" or \"identity crisis,\" especially during significant life transitions. It’s important to acknowledge your feelings—they are valid. Here are some steps you can take towards rediscovering yourself: 1. **Reflect on Your Interests**: Consider what hobbies or interests you had before becoming a mom and wife. Can you rekindle any of those passions? Whether it’s art, writing, sports, or learning something new, finding time for activities that fulfill you can help you reconnect with your identity. 2. **Set Personal Goals**: Identify what you want for yourself, independent of your family roles. These goals can be related to personal development, career aspirations, or even self-care practices. 3. **Schedule Me Time**: Make it a priority to carve out time for yourself regularly. Whether it's a quiet cup of coffee, reading a book, or pursuing a hobby, having those moments can help you feel more balanced and grounded. 4. **Connect with Others**: Surround yourself with friends or family who support you and share your interests. Sometimes simply connecting with others can help you feel less isolated in your feelings. 5. **Communicate with Your Partner**: Share your feelings with your husband. A strong relationship thrives on open communication. He may be able to support you in finding time for yourself or understand what you're going through. 6. **Seek Support**: Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor. Professional support can provide a deeper understanding of your feelings and help you navigate through your identity challenges. 7. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be gentle with yourself. It’s okay to have complex feelings about motherhood and marriage. Acknowledge the difficult emotions, and don’t be afraid to express them. 8. **Explore New Opportunities**: Joining clubs, classes, or groups that revolve around your interests can introduce you to new people and experiences, helping to expand your identity beyond being a mom and wife. 9. **Mindfulness and Gratitude**: While it’s essential to acknowledge your feelings of dissatisfaction, practicing mindfulness and gratitude can help you appreciate the positives in your life while addressing your own needs and desires. Rediscovering who you are outside of your family roles can be a journey, but taking small steps towards self-exploration and self-fulfillment can lead you to a more balanced and joyful life.

Step one is expressing interest in wanting to receiving treatment for the outcome of positive behavioral change. Congratulations you did the first step! You are showing your readiness to start counseling by asking this question. Now the second step is to find a counselor who specializes in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression. The therapeutic orientations I have found to be helpful in treating clients with Anxiety and Depression are a combination of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy with Mindfulness, and Solution Focused Brief Therapy. Receiving meditation for your symptoms if part of the treatment, and the other part is receiving counseling to increase your resilience for future events. Research has found that medication and psychotherapy treatments together shows the most effective outcome for Depression. The third step is to increase your positive self-talk to motivate yourself to attend treatment. As counselors, we are aware of the anxieties and fears that are associated with talking to a new professional for the first time. However, remind yourself that you are doing this to improve your well being. I hope this was helpful, and good luck with your treatment journey.",

Sometimes, just vocalizing your emotions can help you process them. 4. **Practice Self-Care**: Engage in activities that promote your well-being, such as exercise, meditation, hobbies, or spending time with supportive friends. Take notice of how these activities impact your mood. 5. **Evaluate Relationships**: If your feelings are particularly strong around certain individuals, it may be worth examining those relationships. Is this person supportive, or do they drain your energy? Sometimes, distancing yourself from negative influences can improve your emotional state. 6. **Journal**: Keeping a journal can help you track your feelings and identify patterns over time. Writing about your emotions can also provide clarity and relief. 7. **Seek Professional Help**: If these feelings persist and significantly impact your daily life, consulting a mental health professional may be beneficial. They can help you explore your thoughts and feelings in a safe space and provide tailored strategies for coping. Remember, it’s valid to feel the way you do, and seeking understanding is a brave step toward addressing those feelings.",

He estado experimentando episodios de depresión severa (si es lo que creo) por muchos años. Siempre se pone peor. He estado teniendo ataques de pánico, sintiendo que no puedo controlar mis miedos y sintiendo que ya no importa si quiero vivir o morir. El problema es que ya no sé a quién pedirle ayuda. Cuando intento hablar con mis padres, Me congelo y solo puedo hacer bromas porque nunca en mi vida hemos hablado de nuestros sentimientos. Entiendo que hablar de tus emociones puede hacernos sentir inadecuados, y bromear es una manera de manejar ese sentimiento incómodo, pero no hay forma correcta o incorrecta de hablar sobre tus sentimientos. Lo importante es reconocer que necesitas ayuda para manejarlos, y ya tu estas en ese proceso. Tener pequeñas conversaciones con tu familia te ayudara a explicarles los sentimientos que estas experimentando. Es importante que les pidas hacer una cita con un profesional de la salud mental, ya que has estado experimentando síntomas que indican que tu cuerpo ya no puede manejar tus sentimientos y necesita nuevas herramientas.

It's brave of you to share what you're going through, and it's important to acknowledge that what you're experiencing is serious. Feeling trapped in those cycles of panic and depression can be incredibly isolating and painful, but there is help available. Here are some steps you might consider taking: 1. **Find a Trusted Adult:** If talking to your parents feels too difficult right now, consider reaching out to another trusted adult—like a school counselor, teacher, or family friend. They can be a good first step to finding help. 2. **Write it Down:** If verbal communication is tough, try writing a letter or an email to your parents or someone you trust. Share what you’ve been feeling and ask for support. This might give you some distance from the emotion during the conversation. 3. **Seek Professional Help:** If possible, seek out a mental health professional, such as a psychologist or therapist. They can provide a safe space for you to talk about your feelings and help you learn coping strategies. 4. **Hotlines and Resources:** Consider reach out to crisis hotlines or text services. They can provide immediate support and guidance. In the U.S., the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is available at 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) or you can text \"HELLO\" to 741741 for the Crisis Text Line. 5. **Connect with Peers:** Sometimes talking to friends or peers who might be going through similar experiences can help. If your school has support groups or clubs focused on mental health, that could also be a way to connect. 6. **Practice Self-Care:** Try to engage in activities that can provide some relief, even if just momentarily. This might be exercise, art, writing, or spending time in nature. Small acts of self-care can sometimes make a difference. Remember, you are not alone, and there are people and resources out there that can help you through this. Your feelings are valid, and reaching out for support is a positive step forward.",

While it’s valuable that you have researched aspects of mental health and have a strong understanding of your feelings and experiences, self-diagnosis can sometimes lead to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of your symptoms. Here are some points to consider: 1. **Understanding Symptoms**: Being informed about mental health conditions can help you identify symptoms and patterns in your own behavior. However, mental health disorders are nuanced and can manifest differently in different people. 2. **Impact of Labels**: Self-diagnosing can sometimes provide relief by giving you a framework to understand your feelings. However, it can also lead to over-identifying with a label, which might increase anxiety or distress. 3. **Professional Assessment**: A mental health professional can provide a comprehensive assessment that considers your history, symptoms, and overall functioning. They can help rule out other issues, inform you about co-occurring disorders, and recommend appropriate treatments. 4. **Treatment Approaches**: Even if you believe you have certain disorders, a mental health professional can guide you in developing coping strategies and treatment plans tailored to your specific situation. 5. **Community Support**: Engaging in support groups or communities related to mental health can provide you with understanding and shared experiences, which may also help you navigate your feelings and thoughts. 6. **Ongoing Learning**: Continue your research and education about mental health, as it can empower you to advocate for yourself and communicate effectively with professionals. If you're currently struggling, it may be a good time to seek support from a psychologist, psychiatrist, or therapist who can help you explore your concerns and provide a diagnosis or treatment plan that suits your needs.

Check for local groups and see if you can transition those online connections to in-person ones. 5. **Attend events:** Keep an eye out for local events such as fairs, festivals, or concerts.

Even if they aren’t nearby, maintaining those connections can help alleviate loneliness. 10. **Consider professional help:** If you're feeling persistently down, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide support and coping strategies tailored to your situation.

It is more in the second paragraph that I would be inclined to say that further exploration is definitely needed. The diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder is more than just those two symptoms, but there are more mild forms of depression that can be equally damaging to someone if left untreated.However, one of the trickiest parts of this is that someone who feels they are not worth knowing may also believe they are not worth having a therapist know them, and even less worthy of being helped. Do you feel that might be you? If so, could we acknowledge that as a part of the big picture, and all wrapped up in these feelings about yourself, and realizing that thoughts and feelings aren't always rational (in that you are worth getting the help)?My recommendation just from the information would be that you seek out a supportive, listening ear in the form of a therapist, who can allow you the space to express some of these difficult experiences, and help you name FOR YOURSELF, what your struggle is.

Spend time together and be patient as he works through his feelings. 9. **Involve Other Friends:** If he is comfortable, consider involving other friends in activities. A social circle can provide support and distraction. 10. **Practice Self-Care:** Make sure to take care of yourself in the process as well. Supporting someone else can be emotionally taxing, so ensure you have your own support system and ways to recharge. Every individual is different, so be patient and understanding as he navigates his feelings. Your support can be invaluable during this time.",

        "text": "It can be really challenging when a family member, especially a parent, doesn't understand your boundaries or needs regarding sensitive topics like mental health. Here are some steps to consider that might help you communicate your feelings more effectively and establish boundaries: 1. **Choose the Right Time**: Find a calm moment to talk to your mother when you’re not in the middle of an argument. This can help set a more constructive tone for the conversation. 2. **Use \"I\" Statements**: When expressing your feelings, use \"I\" statements to help her understand your perspective. For example, you might say, \"I feel overwhelmed when we talk about my depression, and I really need some time to process my feelings on my own.\" 3. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Be direct about your boundaries. Let her know that you appreciate her concern, but you don’t want to discuss your depression right now. You could say, \"I understand you want to help, but I need some space regarding this topic. Can we talk about something else?\" 4. **Explain Your Needs**: Help her understand that everyone deals with mental health differently. You could mention that opening up about your depression can be difficult, and it’s okay to take time for yourself. 5. **Offer Alternatives**: If she’s trying to connect with you, suggest other topics or activities that can foster a positive interaction without delving into your depression. This can help shift the focus away from the subject that causes tension. 6. **Seek Professional Help**: If conversations continue to lead to conflicts, consider seeking help from a therapist. You could suggest family therapy, which can create a safe space for both of you to express your feelings and improve communication. 7. **Reinforce Your Boundaries**: If she continues to push the topic despite your requests, it might be necessary to firmly reiterate your boundaries. Consistency is key; sometimes, it takes repetition for people to respect your needs. 8. **Practice Self-Care**: Make sure you’re taking care of yourself emotionally. Engage in activities that help you cope with depression, and consider talking with a friend or therapist who can provide the support you need. Remember that it’s okay to prioritize your mental health and to protect your emotional well-being in relationships. It may take time for your mother to understand your perspective, but staying firm and clear about your boundaries is important.",

        "text": "Hello,While one can be sad from time to time, feeling sad \"all the time\" could be a sign of depression. If you feel sad on most days, it is worthwhile speaking to a psychologist to determine whether you suffer clinical depression. Feeling sadness is a normal response to loss, whether you lose a family, friend, job, or something you deem important in your life. However, feeling sadness all the time is a signal that you are not happy about something in your life. If it is related to your family and often relationship with family members could affect our self-esteem and self-worth, then perhaps it is worthwhile exploring what you find unhappy about your relationship with your family. Is it that you do not feel heard, supported or loved? Is it that you feel disrespected, disregarded or feel unimportant? These are just a few examples of common issues that people report that contribute to their depression. To help you to uncover your reasons for your sadness or depression and to cope with them in a healthier and more constructive way, it may be helpful to contact a therapist who could support you with this process. You do not have to deal with it alone. Dr. Virginia Chow, Montreal Psychologist. For more information about depression, please consult my website at www.PsychologyResource.ca",

I'm interested to hear some more information; such as, if you live by yourself or family, if you go to school/employed/unemployed, and what kind of things do you like to do with friends or by yourself. Often times, when we are experiencing a strong emotion that we interpret as negative, we put most of our focus on that negative emotion and struggle to see that we do not always feel that specific emotion. There are typically points in the day (even if it is for only in 1 minute intervals) when we do not feel that negative emotion. When we overgeneralize, we use words like \"always\" or \"never\" and when we use those words and it may not be totally true, we feel the negative emotion based on an inaccuracy which is not fair to you. Ask yourself some of these questions: Am I being realistic when I'm overgeneralizing things? Have I ever noticed a short period of time that I wasn't feeling anxious? What do I notice when I am feeling anxious? What am I thinking about? When was the last time I felt empathy? What was different when I was able to feel empathy?

        "text": "Hello. So, someone made you happy but is no longer around? I am sure that feels devastating. As a counselor I usually have to ponder this kind of thought because it lends itself to suggesting that happiness comes from the external, rather than the internal side of a person's life. Happiness is formed within ourselves. All the external trappings of happiness are usually quite fleeting, and temporary. Even relationships fo not last forever. If we get to a place where we are reliant and dependent on those around us to create happiness in our lives, then we lose the opportunities for us to do it ourselves. We are entirely capable of finding ways to be happy. Sometimes this entails working out issues that are holding us back from reaching a place of peace, or resolution to a specific problem.What I would offer to you, is to find ways in which you can develop happiness for yourself. What do you like about your life as it is right now? What can you do to create change in your life to increase your happiness? These kinds of questions can be valuable to you as you seek out ways to make happiness an internal rather than an external event. Mourning the loss of a social connection (in whatever way that occurred), is part of the grieving process, but it is not permanent. It is a path to healing and moving forward. From this, you can seek out new sources of happiness. I encourage you to remember that happiness is independent of the external experience you have in the world. Happiness is an expression of the internal feelings, so that will be the source or the font of positive emotion from which you really draw. If you are lacking in happiness, then it becomes important to examine why that is, and what you can do about it to promote self-care. Seeking out a professional counselor can also be a good option as you move through the grief/loss process and examine the reasons happiness is not in greater supply.I wish you happiness for every day of your life.Best wishes.",

Here are some suggestions that might help you navigate this difficult time and cultivate your own happiness: 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: Allow yourself to feel sadness and grief. It's natural to miss those who brought you happiness. Journaling about your emotions or talking to a supportive friend can help you process your feelings. 2. **Revisit Happy Memories**: Reflect on the good times you shared with those you’ve lost. This can help you appreciate the positive impact they had on your life while recognizing that it's okay to miss them. 3. **Create New Routines**: Establishing new daily routines can provide structure and a sense of stability. Incorporate activities that you enjoy or want to try, like reading, exercising, or learning a new skill. 4. **Engage in Self-Care**: Prioritize activities that promote your physical and mental well-being. This could include regular exercise, proper nutrition, meditation, or enjoying nature. 5. **Connect with Others**: While it may be difficult to seek new connections, consider joining clubs or groups that align with your interests. Engaging with new people can help you discover new sources of happiness. 6. **Explore Hobbies**: Dive into hobbies or interests that you may have set aside. Cultivating new passions can bring joy and help you focus on personal growth. 7. **Limit Negative Thoughts**: Practice mindfulness or meditation to help manage negative feelings. Techniques such as deep breathing or grounding exercises can help you stay present and minimize overwhelming emotions. 8. **Seek Professional Help**: If you're finding it particularly hard to cope, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can offer guidance and coping strategies tailored to your situation. 9. **Explore Gratitude**: Try to cultivate gratitude for the positive aspects of your life, however small. Keeping a gratitude journal can shift your focus towards the good things, even amid sadness. 10. **Allow Time**: Healing takes time. Be gentle with yourself and recognize that it's okay to feel sad. Over time, you may find new sources of happiness and fulfillment. Remember that it's perfectly normal to feel lost after the loss of significant people in your life. Give yourself grace during this process, and take it one day at a time. You are not alone in this journey.",

Feelings of being emotionally distant but simultaneously feeling an intense, unidentifiable emotion can be quite disconcerting. The metaphor of being a \"caged animal\" suggests a sense of confinement or frustration, which can come from various sources—stress, unresolved feelings, or even a lack of fulfillment in certain areas of life. Here are a few things you might consider to help process what you're experiencing: 1. **Identify the Emotion**: It might help to explore what the internal screaming represents. Could it be frustration, anxiety, or a need for freedom or change? Journaling or talking to someone you trust can sometimes help clarify these feelings. 2. **Physical Outlet**: Engaging in physical activity, such as exercise, dance, or even spending time in nature, can be a productive way to release pent-up energy and emotions. 3. **Mindfulness and Grounding Techniques**: Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or grounding techniques can help you reconnect with your feelings and bring some calmness to the chaos inside. 4. **Creative Expression**: Sometimes, engaging in art, music, or writing can provide an outlet for emotions that are hard to articulate. It might help you feel more connected to your feelings and express the \"scream\" in a different way. 5. **Professional Support**: If these feelings persist and are overwhelming, speaking to a mental health professional can be incredibly beneficial.

Here are a few thoughts that might help you navigate these difficult feelings: 1. **Communicating with Your Parents**: It might be helpful to try talking to your parents in a different way. Sometimes, when emotions are high, it's hard for both sides to understand each other. Maybe express how their reactions make you feel rather than focusing on the events themselves. You could say something like, \"When I share something important, I feel like I'm not being heard.\" This might help them understand your perspective better. 2. **Seeking Support**: If you feel that your friends are not fully supportive or attentive, try to find other outlets for your feelings. This could be a school counselor, a therapist, or even a support group. Speaking with someone trained to help can provide a safe space for you to express your thoughts and feelings. 3. **Self-Care and Coping Strategies**: It's great that you've fought through depression; consider implementing self-care practices like journaling, art, or physical exercise, which can help relieve stress and anxiety. Mindfulness or meditation can also be a powerful tool to help you manage those feelings. 4. **Building Trust**: It's hard to feel alone, especially with people you care about. If your friends aren't providing the support you need, perhaps reaching out to new people, joining clubs, or engaging in community activities can help you find individuals who might better understand you and be there when you need someone to talk to. 5. **Acknowledging Your Feelings**: It's important to validate your own feelings. Recognizing that what you’re experiencing is real and that it's okay to seek help is a strong step towards healing.

This could involve limiting conversations on sensitive topics or finding ways to communicate that protect your well-being. 4. **Communicate with Your Husband**: Share your feelings with your husband. He may not fully understand what you're going through unless you open up. Finding emotional support from him can strengthen your relationship and help alleviate feelings of inadequacy. 5. **Reflect on Your Identity**: Take some time to explore who you are outside of these relationships.

Continue to work on understanding your past and how it shapes your present. Each step you take towards healing is a step in the right direction.

There's a difference between feelings like sadness, discouragement, grief, loneliness and depression, though. Sadness is sadness and sometimes we have to go through a grieving or other process, that is a normal reaction to events in our lives. Depression, on the other hand, is more about being stuck. Lulling yourself with self-care sounds like a healthy response and a way to give yourself support. So as to the uncomfortable but healthy part of your feelings, do the best you can to put names to it and share with a trusted other person. You will find comfort. The part of your situation that's depression -- feeling stuck, not able to get out of bad, concentrate, changes in sleeping and eating, loss of enjoyment in living, poor hygiene, feelings of hopelessness, that's different. First step, identify your own symptoms of depression. If you have any thoughts of hurting yourself, tell someone. If you're not sure, you can try 800-lifenet or other support line to get feedback. First aid for depression includes: daily care and feeding, good sleeping and eating, lots of exercise--even when you don't feel like it-- healthy socializing, and focusing on talking to yourself in a positive way. If you aren't able to move yourself out of your depression, work with a professional to make short-term goals and get some support. You may also talk to your doctor or psychiatrist about trying an anti-depressant to give you a little lift while you go through a rough patch.Best wishes,Karen",

Unfortunately, it sounds like you were offered some that were more dangerous than helpful, but be proud that you were able to curb those before they caused too much harm. From what you have written, stress has always been a difficult thing for you to manage. Often, when I am working with those who offer the same concern, there is a degree of people pleasing that comes with that stress. When we are trying to make others happy, especially when we are unable to distinguish the proper \"rules for success\", it can make even the simplest of tasks overwhelming. Stress management is just that, management; of our own anxieties about the needs of others, about our skills and the ability to complete a task and having multiple requests at any given time. Each of these aspects requires a separate sets of \"tools\" to manage them accordingly. For example, assertiveness communication training could aid in communicating with your colleagues to manage their expectations of your deadlines and abilities, but it will not assist you with managing your own anxieties. Try to separate the different areas of the problem, in order to help yourself to find a solution and work on them in their own time. Perhaps keeping a journal will help you to better understand why you are so easily overwhelmed by stress and help you track some of your less-helpful responses to stress. For example, does a certain person's style of communication always make you feel undervalued and therefore push you to finish their requests first? Is there a certain time of the day where you start to fall off in productivity?

This can help you feel less overwhelmed and more in control. Additionally, consider practicing positive self-talk to counter feelings of hopelessness. 4. **Build a Support Network**: Reach out to friends, family, or support groups where you can share your feelings and experiences.

If not, you can look into community centres for counselling options, check if your doctor will give you a referral or your local religious organization.

The time right after people leave the hospital after receiving psychiatric services is a time of high risk for suicide. It is very important, after hospitalization, to get follow-up care with a professional as soon as possible. If your husband has an established therapist, this is the time to call. It is also a good time to alert your support system of friends, family, clergy or others to let them know he is still struggling. This is good support for him AND you.It is important to think about means and opportunity to make another attempt. Means really do matter. So, if you have a firearm in the home, it is really important to remove it. You can't remove all things that a person may hurt themselves with, but some things are more lethal than others. Firearms are very lethal. I am not sure what means he used last time, but try to reduce the opportunity for him to access it again. This is where your support system can help out. People can take turns hanging out with him until you are sure the crisis is over.If you believe that an attempt is going to occur, talk to your husband about going back to the hospital. If he refuses, you will want to find out what your options are to have him go even if he doesn't want to. I know the thought of that really hurts, but it can save his life. Calling 9-1-1 is always a good option if you are not sure. Usually a suicide crisis, meaning they want to harm themselves right now, lasts a few minutes, hours or days. Sometimes when you get them through the crisis stage, they no longer want to commit suicide. But, as you are indicating, that feeling of wanting to commit suicide can come back again. So, it is always good to have a plan. If you want more information, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. They will always answer: 1-800-273-8255.

One thing I often tell patients is that \"Do you think you are depressed?\" People often answer yes or no, but many individuals respond with a question: How would I know? To that I often explain that if I stopped watching movies or better, stopped enjoying watching movies that would be a clear indication for me that I am delressed. It would be a sign that I have lost pleasure or interest in the activity that I typically enjoy most . I'll ask you to think of one activity which you really really enjoy. It could be anything from reading, to being with friends, to skiing to watching tv. I would like to now ask you if you have stopped enjoying that activity or can't find the motivation to engage in it? This is another symptom of depression: loss in pleasurable activities. The good news is that there are many effective, available treatment if you are indeed in a depression or simply, you want to modify/decrease your depressive symptoms i.e., you want to stop feeling so tired and so worthless. Treatment includes one or more of the following: psychotherapy, medication, exercise. Any one or combination of both of these can help to improve your mood. The even better news is that feeling that you are doing something wrong can diminish with appropriate treatment over time. I hope you find this information helpful. The most important next step is to get evaluated by a mental health professional typically a psychologist or psychiatrist, and for both you and the professional to better understand your symptoms and your mood in the context of what is going on in your life.",

Feeling stuck or unsure about how to move toward your ambitions is a common challenge, but taking small, actionable steps can help you build momentum. Here are some suggestions to help you get started: ### 1. **Identify Your Goals Clearly** - Break down your broader goals (becoming an electrician, operating heavy machinery) into smaller, specific steps. For example: - Research training programs for electricians or heavy machinery operators. - Look into local community colleges or trade schools that offer related courses. ### 2. **Make a Plan** - Create a timeline for achieving your goals. Set short-term and long-term goals to make the process manageable. For example: - Short-term: Enroll in a program within the next three months. - Long-term: Complete your training and obtain a license within the next one to two years. ### 3. **Seek Support** - Talk to your fiancée about your aspirations, and involve her in the planning process. Supporting each other in pursuing your goals can strengthen your partnership. - Connect with mentors in the fields you're interested in. They can provide valuable advice and encouragement. ### 4. **Take Action** - Start small; even minor steps can lead to significant progress. This might be as simple as filling out an application or having a conversation with someone in the field. - Consider attending workshops or informational sessions related to your interests. ### 5. **Build Skills and Experience** - Look for part-time jobs, internships, or volunteer positions in your chosen field to gain experience. - Online resources, videos, and tutorials can also help you learn skills relevant to your goals. ### 6. **Stay Motivated** - Remind yourself of why you want to achieve these goals. Having a clear vision of a better life for your family can help you stay focused. - Celebrate small achievements along the way to keep your spirits high. ### 7. **Consider Financial Planning** - Look into financial aid, grants, or scholarships for training programs if cost is a concern. - Create a budget that allows you to set aside money for training or education. ### 8. **Stay Flexible** - Life can be unpredictable, so remain open to adjusting your plans as needed. Focus on what you can control and stay resilient in the face of challenges. Remember, progress often comes in small steps, and it's okay to take your time. Your determination to create a better life for your family is a powerful motivator, and with a clear plan and consistent effort, you can achieve your goals. Good luck!",

It sounds like you are still wanting to work through whatever challenges you and your husband are having but your husband may not be on the same page. I would encourage you and your husband to seek professional support if you haven't already. While depression can put real strains on a relationship, relationship problems can lead to or contribute to depression and there may be some real benefits to both of you in doing some couple therapy. With that being said - if your husband is not willing to do therapy or is clear that he wants the relationship to end, then I can't see what choice you have but to \"respect his decision\" as you mentioned. This doesn't mean that you have to feel okay with the decision - as I'm sure you wouldn't - but ultimately loving one another and staying in committed relationships is a choice that we each have to make. If he is wanting to leave - this could make things a lot tougher for you. I would encourage you to seek professional support for yourself and reach out to lots of friends and family.

It may also be helpful to evaluate what you want and need from this relationship. If he is not willing or able to be there for you in the way you need, it might be worth considering whether this relationship is serving you or if it's causing more pain.

That is a grief and trauma that is certainly hard to imagine. Trauma and grief can affect us in many ways, and certainly deeply personal things like our sex lives. It may be difficult for others to make the connection, but it is there. So, for example, if stress and trauma make you feel like you are not interested in sex, a partner may take it as a personal rejection rather than response to stress, trauma or grief. If your husband will agree to it, couple's counseling may be your best bet. A counselor can help you with your communication and may be able to provide some education to your husband about trauma and how it can have an impact on intimacy. If he doesn't agree to go, it may be worth it to go on your own. You still have a lot you are dealing with yourself. And sometimes our personally therapy can influence others, so it may be a good idea. It is important to remember that even though you are married you have the right to make decisions about your body, and that includes when you want to have sex with it. I hope this is helpful, and some of my colleagues may have ideas, also. Be well.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",

What you’ve gone through is unimaginable, and it’s completely understandable that it has had a profound effect on your mental health and your relationship. Sexual intimacy can be complicated, especially when dealing with trauma and mental health struggles. It’s important to give yourself compassion and understand that healing takes time. Here are a few steps you might consider to help navigate this challenging situation: 1. **Seek Professional Support:** A therapist who specializes in grief and trauma can provide you with coping strategies and a safe space to express your feelings. They can help you process your loss and the emotions surrounding it. 2. **Communication with Your Husband:** Try to have an open conversation with your husband about your feelings. Expressing your struggles and the impact of your loss on your intimacy can help him understand your perspective better. It might help to emphasize that it’s not about him or your feelings towards him, but rather your own personal healing journey. 3. **Establish Boundaries:** It’s okay to set boundaries around physical intimacy if you’re not feeling ready. Talk about what you’re comfortable with, which may include non-sexual forms of closeness and affection, while you work through your feelings. 4. **Educate Him:** Sometimes partners may not understand the complexities of mental health. Sharing resources or articles on how trauma and depression can affect intimacy might provide him with insights. 5. **Take Your Time:** Healing is not linear, and each person's journey is unique. Allow yourself to heal at your own pace without pressure to resume intimacy before you’re ready. 6. **Support Groups:** Connecting with others who have experienced similar losses can provide a sense of community and understanding, which can be healing. Please remember that you are not alone, and reaching out for help from professionals or support networks can be a vital step in your healing journey.",

However, many clients who struggle with self-harm can find help in outpatient settings - particularly those which offer a treatment called Dialectical Behavioral Therapy (DBT). Looking for a DBT professional or group therapy setting may be particularly helpful, but a skilled professional can help you to figure out how to identify other options even when you are experiencing overwhelming emotions. Without knowing your location, I also recommend searching to find your local helpline or suicide prevention hotline. The volunteers on the other end of the line can be very helpful even if your intention is not suicide and they are likely also to be able to connect you with resources in your area.

Your other concerns, though, seem pretty \"normal\" for someone who is in a relationship with a partner who has children. As a married stepmother, I've been there, and as a therapist, I can tell you that the boundaries and communication skills you have in your relationships need to be healthy for you to feel healthy. Finding some support from a group of others whose partners have children might be really helpful - being able to hear from others that you aren't alone in feeling like this can really lighten the load, and they might have some good ideas for handling certain situations. Another option is to find a counselor or therapist who has experience working with step/blended family dynamics - because even if you're not officially married, those dynamics come into play whenever there are kids from another relationship involved. You may even consider couples counseling so that both of you can learn to talk about your relationship needs and concerns in a way that will encourage connection and strengthen your sense of partnership.",

Taking small steps to care for yourself can also make a difference. Here are a few suggestions: 1. **Seek Support:** Talk to a friend, family member, or a counselor about how you're feeling. Sometimes just sharing your thoughts can lighten the burden. 2. **Set Small Goals:** Break tasks into smaller, manageable parts. Focus on achieving one thing at a time rather than everything at once. 3. **Prioritize Self-Care:** Even when it feels impossible, try to carve out a little time for yourself each day. This could be as simple as taking a short walk, practicing deep breathing, or spending a few moments doing something you enjoy. 4. **Practice Mindfulness:** Techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga can help reduce stress and enhance your mood. Even a few minutes a day can be beneficial. 5. **Create a Routine:** Establishing a daily schedule can provide structure and a sense of normalcy, helping to ease feelings of chaos. 6. **Limit Overwhelm:** If you have too many demands on your time, consider learning to say no to additional responsibilities until you feel more balanced. 7. **Seek Professional Help:** If your feelings of stress, anxiety, or depression are overwhelming, reaching out to a mental health professional can provide support and guidance tailored to your needs. 8. **Physical Health:** Make sure you're eating well, sleeping enough, and getting some physical activity. These can significantly affect your mood and energy levels. Remember, it’s okay to ask for help, and taking care of yourself is important for your overall well-being.",

Your feelings are valid, and it's important to remember that seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. Here are some steps you can consider taking to help you through this difficult time: 1. **Talk to Someone**: Find a trusted friend or family member to talk to. Sharing your feelings can often ease some of the burden you’re carrying. If that's not comfortable, consider seeking professional help from a therapist or counselor who specializes in trauma or military-related issues. 2. **Support Groups**: Look for local or online support groups for veterans or those who've experienced a similar situation. Connecting with others who understand what you're going through can provide a sense of community and support. 3. **Focus on Self-Care**: Try to incorporate activities into your routine that promote your well-being, such as exercise, meditation, or hobbies you enjoy. Taking care of your physical and mental health can help improve your outlook. 4. **Set New Goals**: While it may feel like your dreams of serving in the military are over, consider new goals that align with your interests and passions. This can help create a sense of purpose. 5. **Explore Other Opportunities**: There are many ways to serve your community and country outside of traditional military service. Consider how your skills and experiences can be utilized in other fields or volunteer opportunities. 6. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Remember that your worth isn't tied to your military service. It’s okay to grieve the loss of that dream, but don’t forget to recognize your strengths and the things you bring to the world. 7. **Educate Yourself**: Sometimes learning about the experiences of others who have gone through similar transitions can help. Books, videos, and podcasts on this topic can provide insights and comfort. It’s okay to seek help, and reaching out for support can lead you toward healing.

It's not uncommon to feel trapped in an addiction-like cycle, where the desire becomes stronger the more you try to resist it. Finding effective coping strategies can be tough, especially when typical suggestions like drawing don’t seem to help. Consider exploring a few different approaches: 1. **Identify Triggers**: Reflect on what situations, emotions, or environments lead you to engage in this behavior. Understanding the triggers can help you develop strategies to avoid or cope with them. 2. **Substitution**: If drawing isn't working, try other activities that might engage your mind and body, like physical exercise, writing, or even starting a new hobby that excites you. 3. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: These practices can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings without necessarily acting on them. Apps like Headspace or Calm can guide you. 4. **Support from Others**: Talk to a friend, family member, or a mental health professional who can help provide support or accountability. Sometimes just sharing what you’re going through can be a relief. 5. **Set Small Goals**: Instead of trying to stop entirely, set smaller, manageable goals.

Understanding specific challenges you faced might help you identify areas for improvement without internalizing it as a reflection of your worth. 2. **Focus on Your Strengths**: Make a list of your skills and accomplishments, both professional and personal.

These can be effective in reducing feelings of paralysis during interview situations. 6. **Gradual Exposure**: If possible, start applying for positions that feel a little less intimidating. This could be more casual roles, volunteer opportunities, or internships to build experience and confidence before tackling larger career moves. 7. **Set Realistic Goals**: Break your job search into manageable tasks. Instead of focusing on getting hired, aim to submit a certain number of applications each week or practice interviewing a few times. 8. **Consider Professional Help**: If your depression is worsening, please reach out to a mental health professional. They can help you develop coping strategies and address feelings of hopelessness. 9. **Network and Seek Mentorship**: Connect with mentors, supportive colleagues, or even friends who can offer advice, referrals, or simply moral support. Networking often leads to opportunities that aren't always visible through traditional job postings. 10. **Be Kind to Yourself**: Acknowledge that everyone faces setbacks in their careers. Try to treat yourself with compassion and understand that your worth isn’t defined by a job or others’ perceptions of you. Remember, you are not alone in feeling this way.

The first step is to establish a self-care routine that will help you to feel centered and motivated: go for walks, or make any physical activity that you enjoy ( be kind to yourself, anything helps at this point), eat balanced, add whole grains and fibers to your diet, make a point to rest at night and avoid naps, practice a hobby that you love, or look for a new one that you are curious about. You mentioned that you feel unsettled in your soul: explore your spirituality, meditate about what makes your soul at peace, and find ways to practice that or surround yourself by those activities.If you find it difficult to begin, talk to your therapist to identify roadblocks and ways to find motivation. Suicidal and homicidal thoughts are common but serious depression symptoms, discuss them with your therapist, contact your doctor or psychiatrist, and call 9-1-1 if its and emergency.Once you feel stable, you can focus on exploring the source of the problem and see if you need to make changes or learn coping skills that will help you manage it. It will also be a good time to explore your spirituality and your purpose in life, that may help you to feel better with yourself and then happier around others.¿Cómo puedo volver a ser la persona que realmente soy?Siento que mi mente no está bien.

Siento que soy menos que los demás.Al parecer estas experimentando síntomas de depresión, la cual puede ser causada por cambios recientes en tu vida o estarse acumulando a través del tiempo.Lo importante en este momento es que tú reconoces los síntomas y estas buscando cambiar la situación. El primer paso sería trabajar en restablecer una rutina de cuidado personal que te ayude a sentirte emocionalmente estable y motivado: Sal a caminar o hacer alguna actividad física(ten compasión contigo mismo, cualquier cosa funciona para comenzar), comienza a comer balanceado, especialmente granos y fibras integrales, , procura descansar en las noches y evita las siestas, y practica algún tipo de actividad que hayas disfrutado en el pasado o que te de curiosidad. Mencionaste que tu espíritu esta intranquilo, explora tu espiritualidad, y que te ayudaría a encontrar la paz, busca la manera de hacer esa práctica una rutina.Si te cuesta mucho trabajo iniciar estas actividades, será bueno buscar a un consejero para que te ayude a identificar formas de estar motivado o obstáculos que te estén deteniendo. Es común tener pensamientos que atentan en contra de tu vida o la de otros, discútelos con tu terapeuta, con tu medico primario o psiquiatra, y llama al 9-1-1 si es una emergencia. Ya que consigas estabilidad, puedes comenzar a trabajar o explorar la causa del problema y ver si hay cambios mayores que debes hacer o destrezas que debes aprender para manejar el mismo. También es un buen momento para explorar tu espiritualidad mas profundamente y tu propósito en la vida, cuando encontramos un propósito y como ejercerlo, tendemos a ser más felices con nosotros mismos y con los demás.",

If you can, working with a therapist who is competent in treating depression may be a huge benefit to you and help you to regain a sense of meaning, motivation, and connection. Additionally, anything you can do to give yourself a little break from the feeling of pointlessness and any ruminating thoughts you may be having may be of help. I know it may sound pointless in the moment, and you may feel a great deal of inertia in doing so, but you may find that if you force yourself to do something small that is pleasurable, like taking a walk for example, there's a good chance you will be glad that you did so after the fact.

It’s completely valid to feel this way, and recognizing how you feel is the first step toward making a change. Here are a few suggestions that might help you start feeling more connected and fulfilled: 1. **Reach Out**: Try reaching out to your one friend and suggest doing something together, maybe go for a walk, grab a coffee, or try a new hobby together. Face-to-face interactions can be really uplifting. 2. **Explore New Activities**: Look for local clubs, classes, or community events that interest you. This can be a great way to meet new people and engage in something you enjoy. 3. **Volunteer**: Consider getting involved in a local charity or community service. It’s a wonderful way to meet people, do something meaningful, and get out of the house. 4. **Talk to Your Family**: It might feel a bit uncomfortable, but if you feel safe doing so, try to have a conversation with your family about how you’re feeling. They may not realize how distant things feel for you. 5. **Limit Phone Time**: Try setting specific times for phone use and dedicate the rest of your time to activities that don’t involve screens; this can help reduce feelings of isolation. 6. **Consider Professional Help**: If you’re feeling persistently low or overwhelmed, talking to a therapist or counselor could provide you with support and new strategies for dealing with these feelings. 7. **Personal Goals**: Set small, achievable goals for yourself, whether it’s reading a book, starting a fitness routine, or learning a new skill. This can help create a sense of purpose. 8. **Mindfulness and Self-Care**: Explore mindfulness practices like meditation or journaling, which can help you process your feelings and reduce feelings of loneliness. Small steps can lead to big changes over time. You don’t have to make all these changes at once—pick one or two things to try out first and see how you feel.

Start with the most basic things: Eating balanced meals, sleeping at from 6-8 hours and exercise at least 30 minutes a day. These will help you to regulate the chemical imbalance that affects your mood, plus exercising gives you time to vent and be distracted from your thoughts. Once basic self-care is established, I suggest that is a good time to start exploring the source of these feelings, and address them trough therapy. If you have difficulty initiating self-care routine talk to your therapist about what motivates you and pushes you to do things, you might find the key during the process. You could also contact your physician or a psychiatrist to discuss medication options if it’s too challenging to begin basic self-care.¿Cómo puedo controlar mi ansiedad?Uno de los primeros pasos para manejar la ansiedad y la depresión es establecer una buena rutina de cuidado personal.

If you haven't seen a primary care provider in a while, you may want to. There are health conditions that can affect your mood and energy levels, even at your age. It doesn't hurt to get checked out. If they find the cause, they may be able to treat it and improve the symptoms. In addition, most primary care providers are trained to be able to manage medication for patients who have mild, moderate, and sometimes severe depression. So, don't be surprised if your primary care doctor offers to put you on an anti-depressant if they diagnose you with depression. Medication is not the only way to treat depression, but sometimes it is necessary depending on different factors.2. You may want to consider counseling, since it is another effective way to treat depression. A counselor will help you explore the factors that may be leading to depressive symptoms in the first place. This could include thoughts, behaviors, beliefs, life experiences, and other things. 3. Finally, to answer your question about whether these feelings are \"normal.\" These symptoms could be the sign of an underlying general health or mental health condition.

        "text": "It has been said that depression is often the result of a blocked goal. Often people struggle with both anxiety and depression but have difficulty determining which is the most important issue. For some, depression is the result of frequently blocked goals and when their predominant issues are evaluated, they discover that they are anxious (worried) about a lot of areas in their life but seem to find no relief. When there is no relief and there have been numerous attempts (either in their mind or in practical application) to resolve the anxiety, depression is often the result. In this type of case, depression is not the main or underlying issue. The anxiety is the underlying issue. Having \"a lot on my mind\" sounds like anxiety. Unresolved anxiety can lead to feelings of depression which are often associated with \"emptiness.\" In the question above, I would want to evaluate all of the issues surrounding having \"a lot on my mind\" and determine where these might be coming from. Has there been ongoing rejection from peers? From family? If so, why does this seem to be happening? Isolation is often a protective measure that one implements to avoid further pain. Where does that need to protect originate? Are there unmet needs from childhood? Are there traumatic life events that have created a need to self-protect as a defense mechanism? We can feel \"alone\" even when in a crow of people or at a party. This has nothing, in this case, to do with being around people. It has more to do with how we view ourselves. If there is a prevailing message or script that has been internalized that says, \"You are worth nothing\" or \"You don't deserve the company of others\" then being around people will not alleviate the problem but only exacerbate it. I would want to evaluate how one feels about themselves and what negative messages one has received and has repeated to oneself over time. The Developmental Needs Meeting Strategy is a therapy aimed at addressing unmet childhood needs. If there is specific trauma that is associated with socializing with people, then EMDR can be very helpful in desensitizing and reprocessing the trauma. Looking at whether this individual's issue with emptiness is straight depression or whether it is depression as a result of unresolved anxiety is key to determining a treatment strategy.",

That's a wonderful start.Research on depression shows us that it is very linked to pessimism. You say \"I always see the worst end of things\". That's pessimism. Life is like an elephant. If all you see is roughness, backup and walk around; the view will change. The key to optimism is to build your ability to see the bad things in life as 1. temporary (this will pass. I know how to fix friendships), 2. Specific (not involving the whole of your life), and 3. not your fault (tons of people fail road tests). On the flip side, it helps if we can see good things as 1. more permanent, 2. bleeding into other areas of our lives, and 3. something YOU created. Not taking credit for good things and blaming yourself for the bad ones is typical especially of women. The feelings you are having are temporary; you're in a slump and it's a good time to sit down and look at how you can make the picture look different. I think you know how; but you lack energy right now. If tackling this on your own isn't enough, a therapist can help you take that step back to look at the big picture and help you rebuild your natural resilience and capacity for joy. I wish you the best.",

We're all wonderful, imperfect, complicated people and we're at our best when we're all helping each other. I'm glad you wrote this question, because a lot of people have this feeling sometimes. I can tell that you're smart, because you seem to sense that the two things you wrote about are connected...you \"not being yourself\", and then how you felt when your grandma died. When Grandma died, you needed and deserved extra love and support, but the people around you didn't seem to give it to you, maybe. My hunch is that they wanted to, but that they didn't know how much you needed it, or what you needed exactly. The older you get, the more you will have to take charge of letting people know what you need. Maybe this is one of the suckier parts of being mature, but that's how it works. When you started middle school, it sounds like you changed; you got more quiet, right? That must have felt weird, to not be acting like yourself. It sounds like fear tricked you into thinking people wouldn't like you. Fear can be silly. So then, fear got you to not show yourself, and when we don't show ourselves, people can't see who we are; they don't know us as well and then they don't know what we need and they can't care for us as well either. Fear of not being liked isolated you from the people who love you. It does that to a lot of us. So, where you're at right now is because of what fear did to you, and also because when Grandma died you were already isolated so people couldn't see your pain and know that you needed support. There's a simple solution, but you'd have to be brave enough to look fear in the face and say \"Get off my back!\". \"You're not helping me by telling me lies.\" Can you be brave enough to go back to your old, louder, self? If you talk to the people closest to you...tell them what you think and how you feel, then they'll be able to give you the care that you want and deserve. I wish you well as you try this!",

You didn't say no because you were caught off guard and unprepared; there is no place in life that teaches girls or boys how to manage it when someone crashes a sexual boundary. You also live in a culture where girls are encouraged to be cooperative and not upset people, and to put the needs of other people first. You instinctively want people to like you, and people can be very coercive sexually. You said it yourself; you \"gave in\". He wore you down.There's nothing wrong with you. It wasn't your job to say no. Women aren't the gatekeepers of male sexual urges. It was his job to get your consent first. He pressured you into it. A good therapist would help you to dig deep and uncover all these barriers to saying no and more. If you said no, what might happen then? What might that mean about you? What are you avoiding feeling? Unloved, unwanted, cold? What would you have to believe in order to be confident enough to say no? That you didn't have to do anything you don't want to do? That you're special, or that sexuality is special? Would you need a better understanding of what sexual assault is? I love that you want to do some work here to strengthen your sexual boundaries, and I urge a widespread conversation about what consent it.

It sounds like you're in a very challenging situation, and those feelings of distrust and anxiety can be incredibly overwhelming. It's understandable to feel torn between wanting to repair the relationship and feeling frustrated and hurt. Here are a few suggestions that might help you navigate this difficult time: 1. **Take Time to Reflect**: Before discussing your feelings with your husband, try to spend some time reflecting on what specifically is causing your feelings of distrust and anxiety. Are there particular actions or patterns that trigger these feelings? Understanding your emotions more clearly can help you communicate them more effectively. 2. **Choose the Right Time for Communication**: Find a time when you both can talk without distractions. Choose a calm moment to express your feelings rather than during an argument. This can help prevent the conversation from escalating and allow both of you to be more open. 3. **Use \"I\" Statements**: When you talk to your husband, try using \"I\" statements to express your feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, saying \"I feel anxious when...\" instead of \"You make me feel anxious when...\" can help reduce defensiveness. 4. **Seek to Understand**: Encourage honest communication by asking him how he feels as well. Approach the conversation with a willingness to understand his perspective, which can help foster a sense of teamwork in addressing the issues. 5. **Set Boundaries**: If there are behaviors that are contributing to your feelings of distrust, it can be helpful to identify and set boundaries together. This can create a sense of safety in the relationship. 6. **Consider Professional Help**: If communication continues to be a struggle, you might consider couples therapy. A therapist can provide a neutral space for both of you to express your feelings and work through your challenges with guidance. 7. **Self-care**: Do not forget to take care of your own emotional well-being. Engaging in activities that bring you joy or calm can help manage anxiety and provide clarity. 8. **Recognize Your Feelings**: It's important to recognize that feelings of distrust can stem from both external and internal factors.

It's different now...you're not together anymore, but you can't accept this, right? Good for you for identifying that this situation is damaging your life. You've been grieving for longer than you were together. Oh, but really you've not been grieving...you're stuck still loving her instead of moving forward. Unrequited love is a recipe for eternal heartache. Let's look at some possible blocks to moving forward.It could be that there's something unfinished for you. Maybe you felt hurt and you didn't have the chance to say so, or you felt you hurt her and you didn't have the chance to make it right. Maybe there's a burning question you need to ask or something else you need to say. Maybe you want to tell her you've never stopped loving her, and see if she feels the same way. If this is the case, you have two choices, right? You can reach out and say what you need to say, or you can stop ruminating on that question and let it go. If you reach out, there's no guarantee it will go well or that she'll even respond. Maybe write her a letter and don't send it (or send it...it might be worth the risk). Use the next paragraph to help you decide. Do you know how she feels? How did it end? Did she end it? Was it ended just because of the distance, or are there more differences between you that didn't work? Sometimes people are so in love that they can't clearly see that the other person isn't in love with them anymore. Use the information you have about what she wants for her life...can you honour what she says she needs? If she's asked for distance, you would do well to honour that.A key to moving forward: look at your thoughts and where they're getting stuck. Write it down. What bad thing can happen if you let it go? Or \"If I move forward, that will mean...\" Keep going...what would be the worst part of that? This kind of exploring can help you identify your stuck place.It is possible that you've turned this ending into some kind of negative meaning about you or your future. As in \"If this person doesn't love me, then I'm unlovable\", or \"No one will ever love me as much as she did\". So your need to cling to her in your heart is your way of rejecting that negative message about yourself or the future. Can you find another way to reject that message? Try saying these things to yourself:I know she loved me. There is evidence of that.I was a good partner. There is evidence of that.It's part of life to fall in love and then have to move forward...I can do this and learn from it.Many people like me...that's how I know I'm lovable.It's normal to feel sad. I'm grieving a lost love.I want to move forward and not stare in the rearview mirror.I know more love awaits me if I can get fear out of the way.If this person loved me, others can too, (but not if I'm clinging to some old memory)These are the kinds of things a therapist would explore with you.

The person may feel resentful enough to not participate. And, sometimes the counselor is skillful enough to find a path to your daughter, or any patient's self-interest and engage them in therapy.Family counseling, regardless of your daughter's age, is another way to bring your concerns to your daughter's attention, in a therapy environment in which a counselor would be able to help distinguish the seriousness of your daughter's psychological problem, from simply a difference in viewpoints between you and your daughter, in how to handle certain situations.Also, if you believe your daughter is a threat to herself, then instead of this slower route, get in touch with the emergency psychological assessment service in your town, for a more immediate response.",

Here are some suggestions that might help you manage the stress and provide support for both you and your daughter: 1. **Talk About Your Feelings**: Find someone you trust—a friend, family member, or counselor—to talk to about your concerns. Sharing your feelings can help relieve some of the burden. 2. **Establish a Routine**: Children often thrive on routine. Establishing a consistent daily schedule can create a sense of stability for both of you. 3. **Practice Self-Care**: Make sure you're taking time for yourself. Whether it's taking a short walk, reading a book, or practicing mindfulness, finding moments of peace can help you recharge. 4. **Create a Support Network**: Reach out to family, friends, or community resources for support. Sometimes having someone to help with childcare or just to talk to can make a big difference. 5. **Focus on Open Communication**: Encourage your daughter to express her feelings. This can help you both understand each other better and reduce anxiety. 6. **Stay Positive and Patient**: It’s normal to have ups and downs. Try to focus on the positive aspects of your relationship and the good moments you share. 7. **Seek Professional Help if Needed**: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider speaking with a mental health professional. They can provide strategies and support tailored to your situation. 8. **Engage in Fun Activities Together**: Spend quality time doing activities you both enjoy, whether it’s playing games, cooking, or going on outings. This can strengthen your bond and create positive memories. Remember that it's okay to ask for help and that you're not alone in this. You're doing your best, and that's what matters.",

While there is sometimes relief from symptoms from medication, as you have pointed out, there are often negative side effects as well. While I can't give you advice on whether or not to continue medication, I would urge you to take an inventory of the positive and negative effects that you have noticed and educate yourself as much as possible about the short and long-term costs and benefits of psychiatric medication. If you can find a doctor, psychiatrist, or ARNP who is competent in mental health, it may also benefit you to consult with them.One thing that I am wondering about is, what is your support system like, in regards to your fight against depression? Are you seeing a therapist or attending any therapeutic or supportive group?

It's great that you've been able to recognize the relationship between your thoughts and behaviors and your experience of depression. Since I am not a mental health professional, I can only provide general information and considerations for you to think about. 1. **Self-Reflection**: It's important to continue reflecting on what you're feeling and your experiences. Keep a journal to track your mood, activities, and any triggers you notice. This might help clarify what aspects of your mental health need more attention. 2. **Time and Habits**: Developing good habits, such as regular exercise, healthy eating, and sufficient sleep, can play a significant role in improving your overall mood. Additionally, engaging in activities you once enjoyed, even if you don't immediately feel the joy, can help rekindle interests over time. 3. **Professional Support**: Consider talking to a mental health professional about your feelings and experiences. They can help you assess whether it's beneficial to resume medication or explore alternative therapies, such as therapy, mindfulness practices, or lifestyle adjustments. 4. **Medication**: If you find that the symptoms start to interfere significantly with your daily life, it might be worth discussing medication options again with your healthcare provider. While some people do very well without medication, others find it essential for their well-being. 5. **Gradual Change**: Transitioning away from medication can take time, and it's common to experience fluctuations in mood during this process. Make sure to be patient with yourself and recognize that recovery can take time. 6. **Support System**: Lean on your support system—friends, family, or support groups can be invaluable in your journey. Sharing your feelings and receiving support can provide a sense of connection and understanding. Ultimately, the best course of action is one that aligns with your needs, which might be a combination of therapeutic practices and professional guidance. Please consider reaching out to a mental health professional to explore these options further.",

I know you feel that you may be losing your friendships, but what are the facts that have led to this belief? Really ask yourself, \"are they facts?\" or are they your perspective on events. In regards to your coping behaviours at night, it sounds very isolating and also very silenced. As opposed to the sad music, why not try all music, allowing yourself to experience the wide breadth of emotions that are circling within you.

It's commendable that you are actively seeking ways to help her while considering her well-being. Here are some suggestions that might be helpful: 1. **Professional Support:** While you may have reservations about medication, it's essential for her to receive appropriate professional help. Therapy, particularly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), can be highly beneficial for anxiety and depression. A mental health professional can work with her to develop coping strategies and tools for managing her symptoms. 2. **Psychiatric Service Dog:** As you've identified, a psychiatric service dog can provide emotional support and help mitigate anxiety in public spaces. If your poodle has had a calming effect on her, it might be worth exploring the possibility of getting certified for a service dog or therapy animal that can assist her outside the home. 3. **Gradual Exposure:** Encourage her to gradually face her fears in a safe and controlled way. This could involve simple activities at first, such as stepping outside for short periods, sitting in a quiet public space with you, or eventually going to less crowded areas. It’s important to proceed at her pace to avoid overwhelming her. 4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques:** Techniques such as deep breathing exercises, meditation, and mindfulness can be effective in managing anxiety. You might consider taking a class together or finding resources online that she would feel comfortable exploring. 5. **Support Groups:** There are many organizations and online communities where individuals with anxiety and depression share their experiences and coping strategies. Participating in a support group might help her feel less isolated. 6. **Monitoring Her Well-being:** If her suicidal thoughts or self-harming behavior continue, it's crucial to have a plan in place for crisis situations. This can include having emergency contacts, hotlines, or therapist information readily available. 7. **Educated Discussions About Medication:** While you have reservations about medication, it could be helpful to have an open discussion with her about it. Some people find that medication, combined with therapy, significantly improves their quality of life. If she's open to it, a consultation with a psychiatrist could provide more clarity on her options. 8. **Daily Routine:** Help her establish a daily routine that includes time for self-care activities, gentle exercise, or enjoying a hobby she loves, all in a low-pressure environment. 9. **Patience and Support:** Above all, continue being supportive. Your presence and understanding can be incredibly powerful as she navigates her feelings and fears. Encourage her to take small steps and remind her that it's okay to seek help.

I know that today's culture for young people is more of a \"hook-up\" culture than a dating one. Maybe that means that you develop connections to people but you keep yourself from hoping for a full relationship because no one is doing that anymore. That makes me feel sad. I hear a lot of young women (I'm not sure you're female, but that's my guess) say that they struggle with hook-ups because they can't let themselves hope for a phone call after a hook-up. Research tells us that, after a hook-up, college age women tend to feel used and unworthy, and men tend to feel guilty. I think this scenario works better for men than women, but many of both genders are left unsatisfied in the end.This is only one possible explanation for your anxiety...that your gut knows that it wants to feel fully coupled with someone but you struggle with whether it's okay to want or expect that.Maybe take a moment and listen to anxiety. Anxiety tends to try to convince us that something's wrong with us or something bad's going to happen. Anxiety sometimes prefers to stay vague (it's more difficult to refute it then), but you can try to clarify it's whisperings by asking yourself these questions: What am I afraid of? What is the worst thing that might happen here? Then what might happen, and what would be the worst part of that? Keep going until you find the very worst thing that might happen? Might someone not want you...might you feel rejected...or feel not good enough...you might get hurt?Then when you find that core fear, you can look at your life and I bet you'd find a place where that idea or fear originated. A big moment (or many smaller ones) when you actually DID feel or get rejected or abandoned or hurt. In the end, it's a feeling you're trying to avoid (not life or relationship), and anxiety is trying to help you avoid it by making you overcautious. But this doesn't work for you! Good! With the help of a qualified therapist, you can learn to talk back to anxiety and move forward in life and love with calm. confidence.",

Many people experience anxiety and fear related to relationships, and there can be several underlying reasons for it: 1. **Fear of Vulnerability**: Relationships often require us to be emotionally open and vulnerable, which can be scary. If you've been hurt in the past or if you're worried about being rejected, that fear can manifest as anxiety. 2. **Fear of the Unknown**: The prospect of starting a relationship can be intimidating because it involves stepping into unfamiliar territory. You may feel pressure to meet expectations or fear what might happen if things don't go as planned. 3. **Perfectionism**: If you hold yourself to high standards, you might fear that you won't measure up in a relationship, causing anxiety about how to present yourself or how to act. 4. **Social Anxiety or Generalized Anxiety**: If you tend to feel anxious in social situations overall, it can magnify your feelings when it comes to dating. 5. **Past Experiences**: Previous negative experiences in relationships or conflicts can lead to heightened anxiety about future interactions. 6. **Overthinking**: You might be prone to overanalyzing situations, leading to increased worry about what could go wrong rather than enjoying the positives.

These could include starting with friendships or casually dating to lessen the pressure you feel. 4. **Talk about It**: Continue to share your feelings with someone you trust, like your sister or another friend. Sometimes just talking about your anxiety can help lessen its hold over you. 5. **Therapy**: If you’re comfortable with the idea, speaking to a therapist can provide you with professional support and coping strategies tailored to your needs. 6. **Educate Yourself**: Reading about relationships, boundaries, and self-worth can help you feel more prepared and confident in dating situations. 7. **Romanticizing the Situation**: Instead of viewing dating or a relationship as something that must lead to significant commitments, try to see it as an opportunity for fun and learning about yourself and others.

Questioning mainstream thinking and being in touch with your own views, are signs of strength and clarity in a person.As a therapist, I always tell my patients to avoid anti-depressants.Their effectiveness is in suppressing a person's mood and feelings. If someone does not know how they are feeling, then they will have more difficulty in understanding themselves, their uncertainties and hesitations, and overall, how they relate to others and what they expect from others.Anti-depressants mask how someone feels.In a crisis, temporarily taking anti-depressants may be helpful. If someone is so overwhelmed that they are not functioning, then suppressing unhappy feelings so that the person can get through a day, may be of benefit for a short while.Basically, respect and follow your own opinion about anti-depressants. Your view is shared by many. It is a minority opinion, and very valid. If you would like to shop for a therapist, ask the person on the phone, what their opinions are about anti-depressants.Ideally, you will eventually find a therapist who thinks in a way which is similar to you, or at least similar enough that you will have a sense that you are able to trust working with them on whatever you define as problematic.I hope you will have an easy and productive therapist search!",

Here are some things to consider that might help you navigate this situation: 1. **Seeking Help is Okay**: It's perfectly valid to seek help, especially if you've been feeling this way for a long time. Mental health professionals are trained to provide support and guidance tailored to your unique situation. 2. **Confidentiality**: In most countries, health care providers are required to protect your privacy. Even if you receive a diagnosis, there are protections in place to ensure that your medical records remain confidential, especially regarding sensitive information like mental health. Generally, this information is not accessible to employers or schools without your consent. 3. **Self-Help vs. Professional Help**: While self-help strategies can be beneficial, if you're finding it difficult to cope, seeking professional support may provide you with tools and strategies that you might not have considered. Therapy can help you work through your feelings in a safe environment, and many people find it more effective when combined with self-help methods. 4. **Medication Concerns**: It's important to communicate your past experiences, such as your reaction to the medication, with your doctor. This can help them provide alternative treatments that feel safer for you. Not everyone is prescribed medication, and many people benefit from therapy alone. 5. **Treatment Options**: There are various treatment options apart from medication, including talk therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), and other modalities. Your treatment plan can be tailored based on what you feel comfortable with. 6. **Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT)**: While ECT is still used in some cases, it's typically reserved for severe depression that hasn't responded to other treatments. It is not a common first-line treatment and is usually used when other options have failed. 7. **Your Voice Matters**: Remember that you are an active participant in your mental health care. You can express your concerns, preferences, and treatment goals to any healthcare provider you see. If you do decide to seek help, it might be helpful to prepare a list of your concerns and any questions you have to discuss with your provider. If you're uncomfortable with the idea of medication or specific treatment approaches, be honest about that as well.

Here are some steps you might consider: 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Take some time to understand what specifically is bothering you about your relationship with your girlfriend. Identifying these feelings can provide clarity. 2. **Communicate**: If you feel comfortable, try having an open conversation with her about how you both feel. Sometimes, discussing your feelings can help both of you gain perspective. 3. **Seek Support**: While you feel you have no real friends right now, consider reaching out to family or acquaintances. It can help to talk to someone about what you’re going through. 4. **Explore New Connections**: Think about joining clubs, groups, or activities that interest you. This can be a good way to meet new people and form connections. 5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, talking to a counselor or therapist can be very beneficial. They can offer guidance and support tailored to your situation. 6. **Self-Care**: Focus on activities that bring you joy or peace. Whether it’s exercise, a hobby, or mindfulness practices, nurturing yourself is essential. 7. **Give Yourself Time**: Breakups are difficult, and it’s okay to take your time to heal. Allow yourself to feel what you’re feeling. Remember, it’s okay to feel alone, but you don’t have to stay that way.

If you like reading, look online for a local book club. If you like watching birds, look up a bird watching group.Social isolation increases the intensity of negative feelings.Also, the way healthcare is set up in the US, psychiatrists spend 15 minutes asking a person questions and then giving them a pill script. There is almost no human interest in the person.If you'd like feeling better as a person, then find people. Relying only on our mental health system will keep you feeling low and unsteady.If your life is a little more sheltered and you are in a group home setting or your basic needs are taken care of by someone or some organization, then similar advice is still valid.Find and participate in whatever human settings which appeal to you and are available on a somewhat regular basis.",

Sometimes, people don't know how to help unless you share what you're going through. 2. **Reach Out for Support**: Consider connecting with supportive friends or family members, or seek out online communities where you can share your experiences with others who understand what you’re going through. 3. **Practice Mindfulness or Meditation**: Engaging in mindfulness exercises or meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and learn to observe them without judgment. 4. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: Try to identify specific negative thoughts and challenge them. Ask yourself if they're really true or if there's another way to look at the situation. 5. **Establish a Routine**: Having a daily routine can provide structure and a sense of normalcy. Include activities that you enjoy, even if they feel small. 6. **Engage in Physical Activity**: Exercise can be a powerful way to improve your mood. Consider activities like walking, yoga, or any form of movement that feels good to you. 7. **Consider Professional Help**: If you're not already doing so, consider talking to a therapist or counselor who can work with you to develop coping strategies specifically for your situation. 8. **Limit Social Media**: Sometimes, social media can amplify feelings of loneliness or inadequacy. Take breaks if you find it to be overwhelming. 9. **Set Small Goals**: Focus on achievable daily goals, like taking a short walk or reading a few pages of a book.

When I was about 15, I remember asking my parent's friend, Herman, whether life gets any easier when you get older. He said the problems are actually harder, but you gain the ability to deal with them better. I've been an adult a long time now, and that is so true. If you need someone to talk to, consider a teacher or a school guidance counselor or someone you respect, maybe in church. If they're good and they don't know how to help you, they may know how to get you to someone who can. Also, the idea of not being \"good enough\" is a common psychological event.

Talking to your parents about how you feel can be challenging, but it might help to open up a conversation with them. Here are a few steps to consider: 1. **Choose the Right Time and Place**: Find a quiet moment when you and your parents can sit down without distractions. This can help create a comfortable environment for the conversation. 2. **Start Small**: You can begin by expressing that you’ve been feeling down or struggling. You don’t have to share everything at once—just opening up a little can be a good starting point. 3. **Be Honest About Your Feelings**: You might say something like, \"I've been feeling like I'm not good enough lately, and it's been really hard for me.\" This can help them understand what you're going through. 4. **Ask for Support**: Let them know what would help you. Whether it's talking more frequently, spending time together, or even seeking professional help, expressing what you need can guide them in how to best support you. 5. **Consider Professional Help**: If you feel comfortable, you can also talk about the idea of seeing a counselor. They can provide support and coping strategies to help you deal with these feelings. Remember, it's okay to seek help, and your feelings are valid. Talking about them is a brave step. If you find it hard to talk to your parents directly, you might consider writing them a letter or journal to help clarify your thoughts before you have the conversation.

The theory basically states that you can not control an event but you can control your reaction to the emotions associated with said event. For instance here is an example:A (Action or Event): You need to talk to someone and that person is not calling you back.B (Behavior or Response): You begin to tell yourself that this person is too busy for me or I am not important to this person.C (Consequence): You feel depressed.If you look at the model, B has a direct effect on C. The thought is if you change your reaction to A, then C will have a better consequence, such as:A: stays the same.B (this is what you change): This person must be busy, they will call me back when they get a chance or I can call someone else to lean on for support until this person is available.C: Decreased feelings of depression & overall functioning improves.This is just an example but if you actively work to replace the negative thought patterns that effect your behavior, studies show that your overall outlook and mood will improve. If this model resonates with you, I recommend \"Feeling better, getting better, staying better\" by Alber Ellis. In addition, looking for support groups in your area are a great source of support when you are feeling abandoned or alone.",

The feelings you’re experiencing are valid, and it’s important to acknowledge them as part of your healing process. When it comes to starting the journey of self-improvement and healing, here are some steps you might consider: 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Try to identify what specifically triggers your feelings of abandonment or sadness. Journaling can be a helpful way to process your thoughts and emotions. 2. **Understand Your Patterns**: It might help to recognize patterns in your relationships. Have you noticed similar behaviors or feelings arising in multiple situations? Understanding these patterns can be the first step towards changing them. 3. **Seek Closure**: If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to your past partner to seek closure. Sometimes, understanding their perspective can help you find peace, even if it’s difficult. 4. **Work on Self-Esteem**: Often, feelings of worthlessness or abandonment stem from self-esteem issues. Try to engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself. This could be hobbies, exercise, or setting small goals and achieving them. 5. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: When you start to feel that someone is abandoning you or doesn’t want to be around you, try to challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if there’s evidence to support those beliefs or if they are simply your mind playing tricks on you. 6. **Communicate Openly**: When you feel neglected or anxious about a relationship, consider sharing your feelings with the other person. Open communication can help both parties understand each other better and strengthen the connection. 7. **Professional Support**: If you find that your feelings of abandonment persist and are affecting your daily life, it might be beneficial to seek the help of a therapist or counselor.

This is not something that anyone should just “white knuckle” and try to get through on their own with no help. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy is a technique that has been proven helpful for depression and anxiety. This takes a therapist trained in CBT. There are some things in life that you cannot change and must learn to accept. A lot of people spend time trying to change things that they have no control over. This may be the behavior of someone else in your life or it could be a situation that you cannot change, such as the recent death of a loved one, a lost relationship, or an accident or illness which has left you handicapped. In cases like this, what can change is your attitude and thoughts about the situation that you now find yourself in. One thing that is inevitable about life is that stuff happens and it is not always pleasant. Some people take these unpleasant occurrences very hard and it throws them into a deep depression. Other people seem to be able to handle life’s ups and downs and bounce back. They do this with having positive coping skills in their life. Learning new coping skills is something your therapist can help you with.A lot of people are so focused on trying to change the things in their life that they cannot change and are ignoring the things that they can change. There are things that you can do. Here is a quote for you to consider. “You are getting almost everything that you are getting based on the choices that you have made. You will continue to get the same thing out of life until you make some changes.” Another quote I like is “You will find a way or you will find an excuse.” Don’t ever say that you have no choice. Everyone has a choice. You might not particularly like any of the choices that you are facing, but you do have choices. Not happy in a relationship? You can leave it. Hate your job? Get a new one. If it matters to you, you will find a way. Don’t sit there complaining about everything but not doing anything different or better.Take care of yourself. Exercise is very important not only for your physical health, but for your mental health as well. Eating right and exercising will help you feel better about yourself. Also, find a meditation that works for you. There are progressive muscle relaxation exercises, visual and mental meditations, and many many more.

When it comes to anxiety and social isolation, it's important to understand that these challenges can be deeply ingrained in our thought patterns and behaviors. Here are a few reasons why these feelings might be hard to overcome: 1. **Cognitive Patterns**: Anxiety often involves negative thought patterns, such as catastrophizing or fearing worst-case scenarios. These thought patterns can become habitual, making it difficult to break out of them. 2. **Fear of Judgment**: Social anxiety can stem from a fear of judgment or rejection by others. This fear can make social interactions feel overwhelming, leading to avoidance behaviors that can perpetuate feelings of isolation. 3. **Reinforcement of Isolation**: When you experience anxiety in social situations, you might naturally withdraw, which can reinforce the feeling of isolation. The less you practice socializing, the more daunting it may feel when you try to engage with others. 4. **Lack of Skills**: If you’ve been isolated for an extended period, you may feel rusty when it comes to social skills. This lack of practice can increase anxiety and make social situations more intimidating. 5. **Underlying Issues**: Sometimes, anxiety and isolation can be symptoms of deeper underlying issues, such as past trauma or unresolved conflicts. These issues may require professional support to address effectively. 6. **Biological Factors**: Anxiety can have biological components too, such as imbalances in neurotransmitters. This can make it challenging to simply “will” yourself to feel better. 7. **Disconnection from Support Systems**: If you’ve experienced social isolation, you may have lost touch with friends or support systems that can help you feel more connected and reduce anxiety. Overcoming anxiety and social isolation often takes time and effort. It may be helpful to consider strategies such as gradual exposure to social situations, practicing mindfulness and relaxation techniques, and seeking support from friends, family, or mental health professionals. Remember, everyone's journey is unique, and it’s okay to seek help along the way.",

You’ve taken the first step to dealing with it. You can talk to your doctor, even if your depression isn’t related to your health. He or she can either look at prescribing you an antidepressant or can refer you to a psychologist or psychiatrist.If that’s not really an option for you, there are also helplines (local or national) or support groups where people dealing with similar issues can talk to each other. If you can't find any in your area (newspapers usually publish this information), there are online support groups as well.",

        "text": "Hi there. Thank you reaching out for help. It takes a lot of courage for someone that is being abused to reach out for help. I want you to know that I am here to help you in any way that I can. First and foremost, you did not mention whether or not you had children yourself by this man. I’m going to assume there are. So, the most important thing right at this moment is asking yourself, if you and your children are safe? Is the boyfriend currently living in the home or is he coming and going? If he is coming and going or currently living in the home, my suggestion for you to is to pack a bag for you and your children and go somewhere safe (i.e. family members home, friend or a shelter temporarily). I cannot stress this enough. Although, some people tend to minimize their abusers behavior (i.e. they only do it when they are drinking, they only do it when they are mad), it’s those individuals that find themselves or their children in a serious situation. So, you can never take abuse (physical or mental) lightly because you never know what is going through that persons mind at that particular time. It’s always better to be safe than sorry. Secondly, it will not be safe, helpful or productive to attempt to talk to the abuser about your relationship. Abusers often times try and manipulate you into staying by apologizing or attempting to justify their behaviors. This is the time you would want to go see a magistrate in order to get a protective order for you and your children.It’s unfortunate that your significant other was involved with another women causing pregnancy; however, that is no longer your concern. Your concern at this point is keeping yourself and your children safe. I would also suggest counseling for you and your children in order to work through these issues. I hope this was helpful and please stay safe and take care of yourself.",

Navigating trust issues and communication problems can be very challenging in a marriage, especially after infidelity. Here are some steps you might consider taking: 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Take some time to understand how you feel about your husband and the relationship. Are you looking to rebuild trust, or are you thinking about other options? Being clear on your feelings can help guide your next steps. 2. **Communicate Openly**: When you're ready, have a calm and honest conversation with your husband. Share your feelings, including the hurt caused by his infidelity and any actions you took in response. Use \"I\" statements to express how you feel without placing blame, which can help reduce defensiveness. 3. **Seek Professional Help**: Couples therapy can be incredibly beneficial. A neutral third party can help facilitate communication and offer tools for rebuilding trust. Individual therapy might also help you process your emotions and heal. 4. **Establish Boundaries**: If you decide to work on the relationship, it’s important to set clear boundaries and expectations going forward. Discuss what fidelity means to both of you and what steps are necessary to rebuild trust. 5. **Take Care of Yourself**: Ensure you’re taking care of your emotional and physical well-being. This might include seeking support from friends or family, engaging in self-care activities, or consulting with a therapist. 6. **Focus on the Kids**: Consider how your relationship dynamics impact your children. Strive to maintain a peaceful and stable environment for them, regardless of whether you choose to work on the marriage or not. 7. **Consider the Future**: Think about what you truly want for yourself and your family. If the relationship doesn’t improve despite your efforts, you may need to explore whether staying in the marriage is the best option for your happiness. Remember, healing takes time, and it’s important to prioritize your feelings and well-being. Whatever you choose to do, make sure it's aligned with your values and what you want for yourself in the long term.",

Humans are social creatures who were created to be in connection with others, but sometimes our life experiences or genetics can make that more difficult for some of us. It is possible that these reactions are based on negative reactions you have had with others in the past, maybe your family, or other traumatic interactions with others. It is also possible that they are caused by an underlying condition such as anxiety or depression, which may cause you to be more uncomfortable around others or annoyed by others. Some people are also more bothered by crowded spaces, loud interactions, and the actions of others. Of course you prefer animals (me too!), they provide unconditional love and support, do not judge you, and do not require you to have conversations with them. The fact that you have conversations in your head at night tells me that although you say you do not like people, you are craving some social connection. What is probably the case is that you were never really taught how to interact and have those conversations.

Volunteering at a shelter or fostering pets can provide fulfilling interactions without the stress of human socializing. 8. **Establish Routine and Structure**: Creating a daily routine can help you feel more grounded and reduce anxiety.

Anxiety is incredibly common and while your particular type of existential anxiety might be unique to you - it is very difficult for most people to really comprehend what happens after we die - regardless of the religious or philosophical belief systems we hold. It is the ultimate unknown and some philosophers and psychologists believe that at the root of our day-to-day anxieties is the fear of death or fear of the unknown. Just as it can be really hard to comprehend the ending of life it can also be hard to comprehend an eternal existence. What these both have in common is that we are imaging a future that is ultimately unknowable and this unknown can provoke a lot of anxiety. Mindfulness based practices like meditation - maybe there is something like this in your religious tradition - can be very helpful in making peace with the unknown in the present moment. The more we can learn to live in the moment - the less we get hung up on anticipating outcomes for our lives that may never come true. Mindfulness practices can help you ground, be where you are , relax and regulate your nervous system so that you are able sleep and recuperate, and train your attention to focus on living the life you want to live now - rather than worrying about what happens after you die. Having said all that - it can be profoundly helpful to speak with someone about your anxiety - especially when you feel haunted by it, worry that you are crazy and can't get to sleep.

Many people struggle with concepts of eternity, whether it’s comforting or frightening. It's important to recognize that your feelings are valid, and it’s common for individuals raised in certain belief systems to grapple with the implications of those beliefs. The idea of an eternal existence, even in a place perceived as positive, can evoke feelings of anxiety for several reasons. The concept of forever may seem unfathomable, and the pressure to find meaning or purpose in an unending life can be daunting. In some cases, it may feel like an escape from the finite experiences we have here on Earth, which can add to the anxiety. Here are a few suggestions that might help you process these feelings: 1. **Talk About It**: Sharing your thoughts and feelings with someone you trust—be it a friend, family member, or a mental health professional—can provide relief. They might offer perspectives you hadn’t considered. 2. **Grounding Techniques**: When you find yourself overwhelmed, grounding techniques can help bring your focus back to the present moment. Practices like deep breathing, mindfulness, or focusing on your surroundings can be effective. 3. **Explore Your Beliefs**: If you feel comfortable, exploring your beliefs can lead to a deeper understanding of your feelings. This might involve reading about different perspectives on life after death or discussing your thoughts with someone knowledgeable in your faith or a different philosophy. 4. **Acceptance**: It may help to acknowledge that it’s normal to have these thoughts and that it’s okay to not have all the answers. Embracing uncertainty can sometimes alleviate anxiety. 5. **Seek Professional Help**: If your thoughts are leading to significant anxiety or panic, consider speaking with a mental health professional.

The awesome (and challenging) thing about it is that when you work on the internal aspects that may need attention, you can learn to find a sense of centeredness that comes with practicing mindfulness and asking yourself who you really are and want to be.

But you can learn to put those anxiety-provoking thoughts on a parking lot, and focus on pleasurable thoughts, or the activity that you need to complete on the time being.· Plan, organize, delegate: Create a schedule to manage demands, organize priorities, and delegate or share responsibilities. Work as a team with your family, so you can share the load. Prioritize actives, shores, and expenses. Focus on the urgent, necessary, and spread apart the not so urgent.· Identify triggers: Once you understand what causes your anxiety, you can learn to channel process and refocus your thoughts. You can also learn coping strategies to manage the problem or give up the desire to control it if needed.· Learn coping skills: Having a balanced lifestyle helps tremendously to reduce and manage anxiety symptoms.

Trabaja en equipo con tu familia, de manera que puedas compartir la carga. Organiza las actividades, gastos y tareas por prioridad.

There could be a number of things occurring. Therapy is a delicate, private decision and I would first like to commend you for the fact that you are not giving up, that you are working to figure this out, and make this work, it sounds like you are engaged and motivated to receive support from a professional, your continued dedication and motivation will take you far. I would first start by asking if you have discussed this with your therapist, if you feel comfortable enough telling your therapist what is going on, maybe inform the therapist that that you feel nervous and shaky. I am a firm believer in open communication between the client and therapist as this builds a healthy therapeutic relationship that yields positive outcomes, if this can be obtained and well received. This is YOUR time for healing and therapy should be a safe, supportive environment to not only process but to seek support and guidance from a professional who can help you move past the barriers. If you feel you are comfortable and able to speak to your therapist, that would be my first suggestion, is to tell he or she how you are feeling. If they know then they can help determine the potential cause and allow you to process and move forward. If this is left un resolved it will be hard for you to move forward. If you are not comfortable discussing this with your therapist, this may be something to take into consideration and worthy of thinking about: why you are not comfortable speaking to the therapist. I understand this is difficult. If I may offer one more suggestion, breathing exercises are very beneficial. Remind yourself what you are working to achieve, close your eyes in a safe moment and breathe in and out slowly, in slowly through your nose and out through your mouth with pursed lips. Breathe in for approximately 5-10 seconds, then let it out slowly. Be sure and do this when you are in private, and feel safe environment. When you begin, I suggest putting your hand on your stomach, over your belly button to feel yourself actually taking in those deep breaths. I know it may sound kind of silly but they really work and are incredibly helpful. We often forget to breathe, especially when we are feeling anxious. You are supported here and try taking yourself through the above thought process and breathing and practice the breathing several times a day. I hope this shaky and uneasy feeling eases.

Here are a few things to consider: 1. **Building Trust Takes Time**: It can take several sessions to establish trust and feel fully comfortable in the therapeutic space. With consistency, you may find that your nerves lessen. 2. **Self-Compassion**: Acknowledge your feelings without judgment.

When we are on high alert, we tend to look for threats and often the greatest threats we experience on a daily basis are social in nature. To some extent this is normal, for example, when people experience late onset deafness, they often will worry people are talking about them (and usually not good things) because our brains tend to jump to that. Of course, I'm not saying you are going deaf or anything, just giving an example. Counseling can help you work through this anxiety. It may also be helpful to reach out to a counselor to rule out if there may be other things going on. Sometimes things like paranoia can blend in with anxiety, which is a very distressing experience.

Anything you can think of that might help you relax. If it involves needing to get up, that's okay!

It sounds really difficult to deal with recurrent nightmares and the anxiety that can come with them. Poor sleep can affect both your physical and mental health, so it's important to address these issues. Here are a few suggestions that might help you: 1. **Create a Relaxing Bedtime Routine:** Establish a calming routine before bed to help signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This could include activities such as reading, listening to soothing music, or practicing deep breathing exercises. 2. **Limit Screen Time:** Try to avoid screens (phones, tablets, TVs) at least an hour before bed, as the blue light emitted can interfere with your ability to fall asleep. 3. **Keep a Dream Journal:** Writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up can help you process them. Sometimes, understanding or reflecting on the content can lessen their grip on you. 4. **Talk to Someone:** It might help to reach out to a trusted friend, family member, or a mental health professional. They can provide support and guidance in coping with your dreams and anxiety around sleep. 5. **Practice Relaxation Techniques:** Techniques such as meditation, yoga, or progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce anxiety and improve sleep quality. 6. **Consider Professional Help:** If nightmares persist and significantly affect your life, a therapist who specializes in sleep disorders or trauma may be beneficial. They can help you explore strategies tailored to your needs. 7. **Evaluate Sleep Environment:** Make sure your sleeping environment is conducive to rest. This includes a comfortable mattress, a dark and quiet room, and a slightly cool temperature. Sleep is an essential part of well-being, and taking steps to address these issues can significantly improve your quality of life. If you're experiencing ongoing sleep disturbances, seeking professional help is an important step.",

Here are some steps you might consider to help cope with the situation: 1. **Communicate Your Feelings**: Before making any drastic decisions, try to have an open and honest conversation with your boyfriend. Share how you’re feeling—your sadness, sense of neglect, and any anxiety you have about his new job and the changes in your relationship. 2. **Set Expectations Together**: Discuss how often you both would like to communicate when he's away. Establishing regular check-ins, whether through text, calls, or video chats, can help you feel more connected. 3. **Stay Busy**: Engaging in activities you enjoy can help distract you from feelings of loneliness.

Give it some time, and try to be patient with each other as you adjust to these changes. 8. **Consider Your Needs**: Assess what you truly need in a relationship. If you feel that your needs for communication and connection aren’t being met despite your efforts, it might be worth discussing these needs more thoroughly with your boyfriend.

Rehearse your presentations multiple times. You can practice in front of a mirror, record yourself, or present to friends or family for feedback. 2. **Start Small**: If possible, begin by speaking in smaller, less intimidating groups. This could be a study group or a smaller class setting. Gradually work your way up to larger audiences. 3. **Know Your Material**: Thoroughly understand your topic. This will not only improve your confidence but also make it easier to handle questions or discussions that may arise after your presentation. 4. **Visualization Techniques**: Before your presentation, visualize yourself succeeding. Picture the audience reacting positively and imagine yourself delivering your talk confidently. 5. **Breathing Exercises**: Practice deep breathing exercises before your presentation to calm your nerves. This helps lower anxiety and improves focus. 6. **Positive Self-Talk**: Challenge negative thoughts and replace them with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths and past successes. 7. **Engage with Your Audience**: Try to make eye contact and interact with your audience. This can help create a connection and make the presentation feel more like a conversation. 8. **Learn from Others**: Watch videos of great presenters and note what makes them effective. You might emulate their techniques, such as body language, pacing, or how they engage with the audience. 9. **Seek Feedback**: After each presentation, ask for constructive feedback. This can help you identify areas for improvement and acknowledge your strengths. 10. **Stay Organized**: Have a clear structure for your presentations (introduction, main points, conclusion). Knowing where you’re heading can reduce uncertainty and anxiety during delivery. 11. **Join a Public Speaking Group**: Consider joining organizations like Toastmasters, where you can practice public speaking in a supportive environment. 12. **Accept Imperfection**: Remember that no presentation is perfect. Mistakes happen to everyone. Focus on conveying your message rather than aiming for perfection. Building confidence takes time, so be patient with yourself.

Start small, like greeting a classmate you haven't spoken to before, and gradually work your way up to larger groups. 3. **Prepare Yourself**: If you know you’ll be entering a social situation, prepare by thinking of a few topics you can talk about. This might make you feel more confident. 4. **Use Breathing Techniques**: When you feel anxious, practice deep breathing exercises. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a few seconds, and exhale slowly through your mouth. This can help calm your nerves. 5. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: Try to identify and challenge any negative thoughts you have about social situations. Are these thoughts based on facts? Often, our fears are worse than reality. 6. **Seek Support**: Consider talking to someone you trust about how you're feeling, whether it’s a friend, family member, or a school counselor. They may offer support, understanding, or even strategies to help you cope. 7. **Join a Small Group**: If you're comfortable, consider joining a small club or group related to an interest of yours. This can help you meet new people in a setting that feels more relaxed. 8. **Set Realistic Goals**: Start setting small, realistic goals for yourself, such as saying hello to someone new or participating once in class each week. Celebrate your successes, no matter how small! 9. **Consider Professional Help**: If your anxiety feels overwhelming and it significantly impacts your daily life, you may want to talk to a mental health professional who can provide tailored support. 10. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Everyone has their unique challenges, and it's okay to take time to work through yours at your own pace. Remember, overcoming social anxiety is a gradual process, and it’s perfectly okay to take it one step at a time.",

As you said, these are intrusive and unwanted thoughts - not genuine desires to harm them. This is a form of OCD we often call Harm or Pedophilic OCD. What you are describing here as \"paranoia\" sounds similar to this, and is so demoralizing because you are dealing both with the distress of these unwanted thoughts and feelings, as well as the fear and uncertainty about your own character as a good person.If this is really what is going on (further assessment by the right professional would determine this), the current gold standard approach to addressing OCD is Exposure with Response Prevention - in this case, confronting the feared situations, thoughts or images on purpose, rather than avoiding them, until they lose the fear and shame associated with them.",

Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful. Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child, and others may experience guilt. If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you, it may be worth working through them with a therapist. A support group list is available through www.autismspeaks.org and may help connect you with others raising children with autism.A second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in.

But for many people, this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life. They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many self-help books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear. I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others. The truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever \"get over\", but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently. A colleague may offer some other advice, as well.. Be wellRobin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",

However, if these thoughts are causing you distress or interfere with your daily life, it may be beneficial to talk to a mental health professional. They can help you explore the underlying causes of these thoughts and provide support in managing them. You're not alone in experiencing such feelings, and reaching out for help is a positive step towards understanding and healing.",

It’s important to talk to a healthcare professional about what you're going through, as they can provide support and guidance tailored to your situation. In the meantime, here are a few strategies that some people find helpful for managing panic attacks: 1. **Deep Breathing**: Focus on slow, deep breaths to help calm your body. Inhale deeply through your nose, hold for a moment, and then exhale slowly through your mouth. 2. **Grounding Techniques**: Try the 5-4-3-2-1 technique, where you identify 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, and 1 thing you can taste. 3. **Progressive Muscle Relaxation**: Tense and then relax different muscle groups in your body, starting from your toes and working your way up to your head. 4. **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Regular practice can help reduce anxiety and improve your reaction to stress. 5. **Limit Stimulants**: Reducing caffeine, nicotine, and other stimulants can help decrease anxiety. 6. **Talk to Someone**: Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend or family member can provide relief. 7. **Professional Help**: Seek support from a therapist or counselor who specializes in anxiety and panic disorders.

One layer is the daunting news that your son has autism. Many parents can feel overwhelmed and distraught with this diagnosis. The vast array of treatments available is daunting in and of itself at times to wrap one's head around. Taking time to reflect or seek out therapy regarding how this diagnosis has impacted you may be helpful. Some parents feel their individual identity gets lost in the diagnosis because they have dropped everything to help their child, and others may experience guilt. If either of these or other feelings come to the forefront for you, it may be worth working through them with a therapist. A support group list is available through www.autismspeaks.org and may help connect you with others raising children with autism.A second layer is the abusive relationship you were involved in. The trauma you experienced in this relationship may have a very meaningful impact on your ability to trust and to be intimate with others. Engaging with a therapist can help facilitate the healing process, as well as paving the way for more comfortable and trusting relationships.",

Taking the step to seek comfort and support in social situations is a positive move. Here are some strategies that may help you feel more comfortable: 1. **Start Small**: Begin by engaging in low-pressure social situations. This could be a brief chat with a neighbor, attending a small gathering, or participating in a community event where you can mingle without the pressure of deep conversation. 2. **Practice Mindfulness and Relaxation**: Techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, or yoga can help manage anxiety and increase your comfort in social situations. Practicing these techniques regularly can help you develop a sense of calm. 3. **Seek Supportive Communities**: Look for groups focused on shared interests or experiences, such as support groups for parents of children with autism. This can provide a sense of belonging and reduce feelings of isolation. 4. **Set Boundaries**: If you feel overwhelmed in social settings, remember that it’s okay to take breaks or leave early. Setting personal boundaries can help you feel more in control. 5. **Focus on Listening**: Sometimes, shifting the focus from yourself to others can ease anxiety. Practice being an attentive listener and ask open-ended questions. This can take the pressure off you and make conversations more enjoyable. 6. **Build Your Confidence Gradually**: Challenge yourself to take little steps outside of your comfort zone. Celebrate successes, no matter how small, as you engage more with others. 7. **Consider Professional Support**: A therapist or counselor can provide valuable strategies tailored to your situation, helping you work through your feelings and develop coping mechanisms. 8. **Reconnect with Old Friends**: Sometimes, reaching out to people you used to know can be a gentle way to rebuild your social skills. They'll likely appreciate hearing from you, and it may help reduce feelings of anxiety. 9. **Self-Compassion**: Remember to be kind to yourself. It’s natural to feel nervous after experiencing trauma. Acknowledge your feelings without judgment and recognize your progress over time. 10. **Involve Your Son**: Bring your son along to some activities. This can help ease your anxiety and provide you with shared experiences to bond over, while also familiarizing yourself with other families in similar situations. Take things at your own pace and understand that feeling more comfortable around others is a journey.

There isn't really enough information provided here to suggest a particular disorder, but it might be worth meeting with a counselor or therapist to do a formal assessment. Some of the questions they might ask could be what other kinds of physical symptoms you experience, how frequently these physical symptoms happen, what's going on for you when they tend to happen, and how frequently/intensely you find yourself worrying in general. Anxiety itself is a really natural thing - it's just when it starts interfering with your ability to \"do life\" the way you want that we start to consider potential disorders. It might be that for the most part, the anxiety you feel is normal and you simply have some triggers that intensify it more than usual.

But for many people, this fear can become so awful that it begins to have a real negative impact on their quality of life. They will try to avoid any situation that they even THINK will cause them embarrassment or anxiety. Escaping a possible embarrassing moment by avoiding or isolating may cause some relief at first, but then many times the avoidance will eventually lead to loneliness, isolation, and even despair. By avoiding, we can also miss out on things that make us feel alive and bring enjoyment. There are many self-help books that offer advice on this issue. You can do an internet search, and I recommend reading the reviews of the book. That is great way to find out if others have found the book helpful. Another option is to seek a counselor to help you with this fear. I would recommend a counselor who specializes in helping people who have anxiety or social anxiety. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy is a good choice for helping with anxiety, but there are many others. The truth is that anxiety and fear of embarrassing ourselves is not something that any of us will ever \"get over\", but we can learn to respond to those feelings differently. A colleague may offer some other advice, as well.. Be wellRobin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",

Be patient with yourself and keep pushing forward, even if progress feels slow. Remember, it's okay to ask for help and take things at your own pace. The journey to overcoming fear is often a gradual process.",

Trying deep breathing exercises, identifying objects around you, or engaging in physical activities can help. 2. **Journaling**: Writing down your thoughts and experiences can be a way to process what you’re hearing and may provide some relief. 3. **Distraction**: Engaging in activities you enjoy—like reading, listening to music, drawing, or spending time with friends—can help divert your attention from the voices. 4. **Mindfulness and meditation**: Practicing mindfulness can help you observe your thoughts without judgment and make it easier to detach from distressing voices. 5. **Support groups**: If you feel comfortable, consider reaching out to others who share similar experiences. Sometimes hearing other people’s stories can help you feel less alone. It's really crucial to seek professional help.

Alternatives to hitting your head require constant gentle reminders to do these new behaviors, or if you've discovered a satisfying alternative in one moment, time is required for you to repeat this alternative until it feels natural.Anxiety usually means someone did not feel well understood growing up and was rushed to comply with the wishes of others who were a regular part of their lives.Anxiety lessens as the person starts to know and accept their wishes and needs as valid. Allow yourself to learn who you truly are in the spirit of accepting whatever you discover about yourself.The behaviors will naturally change with your new understanding and self acceptance.Good luck and enjoy this self discovery project!",

Headbanging or hitting your head can be a way to cope with stress, anxiety, or overwhelming emotions, and it's important to address the underlying issues. Here are some steps you can take to help yourself: 1. **Seek Professional Help**: Consider talking to a mental health professional, such as a therapist or psychiatrist. They can help you uncover any underlying trauma or anxiety triggers and provide you with coping strategies. 2. **Self-Monitor**: Try to become more aware of when and why you hit your head. Keeping a journal can help you identify triggers or patterns related to your behavior. 3. **Practice Mindfulness**: Engaging in mindfulness or meditation can help you become more aware of your thoughts and feelings. This awareness may help you recognize when you’re inclined to hit your head and intervene before it happens. 4. **Find Alternative Coping Strategies**: Explore other ways to manage your anxiety or overwhelming emotions, such as deep breathing exercises, physical activity, or engaging in creative outlets like art or music. 5. **Establish a Safety Plan**: If hitting your head poses a risk of injury, create a safety plan for when you feel the urge to do it. This could include moving to a safe space, finding something else to hit (like a pillow), or having a friend or family member who can support you. 6. **Build a Support Network**: Surround yourself with understanding friends and family who can help you cope. Sometimes just talking about your feelings can alleviate some of the pressure you may feel. 7. **Gradual Change**: Be patient with yourself as you work to change this behavior.

Grief, guilt, anxiety, and trauma can be incredibly heavy to carry alone. Here are some things to consider that might help you work through your feelings: 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's okay to feel grief and guilt. These are natural responses to loss, especially in complex situations. Allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment. 2. **Find Alternative Support**: If you’re not ready to see a therapist, consider talking to trusted friends or family members who can provide support. Joining support groups, either in-person or online, focused on grief and addiction may also be helpful. 3. **Journaling**: Writing down your thoughts and feelings can be a therapeutic process. It can help you clarify what you’re experiencing and allow you to express emotions that may be hard to voice. 4. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or yoga can help reduce anxiety and bring a sense of calm. They can be good tools for grounding yourself when anxiety feels overwhelming. 5. **Focus on Self-Care**: Engage in activities that nurture you, whether it’s spending time in nature, reading, or practicing a hobby. Taking care of your physical health—such as eating well and getting enough rest—can also positively influence your mental well-being. 6. **Consider Different Therapies**: If you decide to give therapy another try, look for a therapist who specializes in grief and trauma and is experienced in working with individuals who have had negative experiences in the past. Consider interviewing them first to ensure you feel comfortable. 7. **Set Boundaries**: In complicated relationship issues, it's essential to establish what is acceptable for you. This might mean taking a step back or limiting interactions with individuals who contribute to your anxiety. 8. **Educate Yourself**: Sometimes, learning more about grief and trauma can help you understand your feelings better and recognize that what you’re going through is a common human experience. 9. **Creative Expression**: Engaging in creative activities like art, music, or writing can be a powerful way to process your emotions. 10. **Helplines or Hotlines**: If you find yourself in acute distress, don’t hesitate to reach out to helplines or services that can provide support without the need for a long-term commitment.

That is totally normal and understandable given your circumstances. Another thing that is not unusual is that you feel better when you sit and rock. That is actually a fairly common way that many people comfort themselves in times of high stress. If you are concerned that there is an actual physical illness causing these symptoms, you may want to visit your primary care provider. They may tell you that they don't see anything physically wrong with you, and at that point you may want to visit a counselor about the symptoms and your relationship experience. A visit with a counselor may be a good idea either way. I work as a counselor in primary care, and I promise you that many people have very real physical symptoms when they have gone through abuse. Unexplainable stomach and headaches are very common. Sometimes, with counseling, those physical symptoms actually stop. Be well, and I hope you feel better soon.Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPCC, NCC",

Explain how the 0.5 mg dose has not been effective in managing your anxiety on a daily basis, but mention that you find relief with 1 mg during a panic attack. 2. **Express Your Concerns**: Let your psychologist know that you are worried about your anxiety attacks and how they impact your daily life. This shows that you're taking your mental health seriously. 3. **Ask for Her Professional Opinion**: Instead of directly asking for an increase to 1 mg, you could frame it as a question. For example, \"Given my experience with the 0.5 mg dosage and how I respond to 1 mg during an attack, do you think increasing the dose might be a good option?\" 4. **Discuss Your Treatment Goals**: Share your goals for treatment and improving your anxiety management.

It’s important to recognize that having a healthy sexual relationship can be safe and fulfilling when precautions are taken.

It’s important that both of you understand each other's perspectives and work together to find a solution. Your partner should be aware of your concerns and can help reassure you. 2. **Education**: Sometimes, fear stems from a lack of information. Educate yourself about safe sex practices, STIs, and contraception. Knowing that you are taking precautions and understanding the risks can help alleviate some of your anxiety. 3. **Gradual Approach**: If you feel overwhelmed, consider taking a gradual approach. Start with intimate moments that don’t involve penetrative sex, such as cuddling or kissing. This can help build intimacy and comfort without the pressure. 4. **Consult a Professional**: If your anxiety feels unmanageable, it may be helpful to talk to a therapist or counselor who specializes in sexual health or relationships. They can help you work through your fears and develop coping strategies. 5. **Focus on Consent**: Make sure that both you and your partner feel comfortable and consent to any sexual activity. This mutual understanding can help create a safer emotional space for both of you. 6. **Reassess Your Comfort Level**: Take time to assess what specifically makes you feel scared and whether those fears are based on facts or assumptions. Addressing specific fears can be beneficial. 7. **Consider Your Partner’s Needs**: While it's important to address your own fears, consider your partner's feelings and desires too. Finding a balance where both partners feel satisfied and respected is crucial. Ultimately, prioritizing communication and comfort can go a long way in building a healthy sexual relationship.

Once we understand the source, it is important to normalize the situations that got us there and find balance in our lives.First, car accidents are common, and since they are accidents they are not a reflection of us. When we have an accident we feel anxious, worried, and may have some trauma after the accidents. If you have been experiencing anxiety since the car accident, talk to your doctor or therapist about it. Second, a lot of people fail classes, tasks, deadlines, etc. but they don’t give up on their goal. We have to remember that failing is part of the learning process, and having the courage to try again is what gives us determination and character. Remind yourself what motivated you to leave your job, and the courage and determination that took to do so, then channel that energy back into school. Third, when we have problems in our relationships, is helpful to look for ways to improve communication, discuss our concerns and how we want to resolve them, but it may be that the relationship needs to end if there isn’t enough interest in one of the parts or if there’s verbal or emotional abuse. Consider talking to your boyfriend and set some boundaries regarding appropriate communication.At all times: focus on being kind to yourself and improving your self-esteem: increase self-care activities, do more things that you enjoy, meditate in what gives you peace and make an effort to have more of that in your life. At the end, you are the one in control of your life, and you determine who you become.¿Qué puedo hacer cuando siento que mi vida está fuera de control?Estuve en un accidente de auto, y fue pérdida total. Deje mi trabajo de 9 años para completar un grado a tiempo completo. Falle una clase, y mi novio piensa que soy estúpida, el quiere dejarme. No tengo a donde ir y siento que lo estoy perdiendo todo.Cuando nos sentimos agobiados es importante reconocer donde estamos parados y entender de donde vienen esas emociones. Ya que entendemos la fuente de agobio, es importante normalizar las situaciones que lo causaron, y volver a encontrar el balance en nuestra vida.Primero, los accidentes de auto son comunes, y por ser accidentes no son un reflejo de nosotros o nuestras destrezas. Cuando experimentamos accidentes no s sentimos ansiosos, preocupados, y puede que experimentemos algún trauma. Si sientes ansiedad, extrema preocupación habla con tu doctor o terapista al respecto. Segundo, muchas personas fallan clases, tareas, fechas de entrega, pero no se rinden. Tenemos que recordar que fallar es parte del proceso de aprendizaje, y tener el valor de intentarlo de nuevo, es lo que nos da determinación y carácter. Recuerda que te impulsó a dejar tu trabajo y canaliza esa energía en la escuela. Tercero, cuando tenemos problemas en las relaciones, es importante comunicar nuestras preocupaciones y diferencias, pero puede ser que la relación termine si no hay interés mutuo o si hay algún tipo de abuso. Considera hablar con tu novio y establecer límites respecto a la comunicación apropiada.En todo momento: enfócate en cuidarte a ti misma y mejorar tu autoestima, aumenta las actividades que te ayudan a sentirte bien, medita sobre lo que te paz y pasa más tiempo practicando esas actividades.",

They might be able to offer support or reassurance. 5. **Consider a Sleep Aid**: If you think it would help, consider using a sleep app or white noise machine to create a more calming sound environment. 6. **Stay Grounded**: If you wake up in the night feeling scared, grounding techniques such as focusing on your breathing or doing a mental checklist of items around you can help. If your fear of sleeping alone persist or worsens, it might be a good idea to speak with a professional who can provide additional support. You’re not alone in this; many people experience similar feelings.",

It's understandable to feel anxious before a competition or event, especially if you're not enjoying it as much as the other sports you play. Here are a few things you might consider: 1. **Communicate with your dad**: It might help to talk to your dad about how you're feeling. Let him know that track is causing you a lot of stress and anxiety. He may not realize how much it's affecting you, and having an open conversation could lead to a better understanding. 2. **Explore your feelings**: Take some time to reflect on why you’re feeling this way. Is it the pressure to perform, the fear of not meeting expectations, or something else? Understanding your feelings can help you address them more effectively. 3. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Before meets, try some techniques to manage your anxiety. Deep breathing, visualization, or positive affirmations can help calm your nerves. 4. **Seek support**: Talk to your coach, teammates, or friends about how you're feeling. They might have some tips, or simply knowing that others understand can be comforting. 5. **Consider your options**: If track is truly making you unhappy, it’s okay to think about stepping back from it. It’s important to find joy in the sports you play, and if track isn’t providing that for you, it might be worth considering if you want to continue. Ultimately, your mental and emotional well-being is important, and finding a balance that works for you is key.",

        "text": "It's completely normal to feel scared or anxious about reaching out and making new connections, especially if you’re not used to being in social situations with popular people. Here are some strategies that might help you work through your fear: 1. **Start Small**: Begin by initiating small conversations with people you already know or in low-pressure settings. This could be as simple as casual greetings or small talk. Gradually build your confidence from there. 2. **Practice Active Listening**: Focus on listening rather than worrying about what you’re going to say next. Asking open-ended questions can help keep the conversation flowing. When you show genuine interest in others, it often puts them at ease and can make social interactions feel more natural. 3. **Reframe Your Mindset**: Instead of thinking of popular people as intimidating, try to see them as just individuals, like you. They likely have their own insecurities and appreciate kindness and authenticity. 4. **Set Realistic Goals**: Instead of aiming for popularity right off the bat, consider setting small, achievable social goals. For example, aim to have a brief conversation with one new person each week or join a group activity to meet others gradually. 5. **Visualize Success**: Spend some time visualizing yourself in social situations where you feel confident. Picture the conversations going well, and let that image motivate you when you’re feeling anxious. 6. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself and recognize that it’s okay to struggle with social interactions. Everyone has their own journey, and it’s important to acknowledge your progress, no matter how small. 7. **Join Clubs or Activities**: Engaging in activities that interest you can be a great way to meet people and create natural opportunities for conversation. Shared interests can make it easier to connect. 8. **Seek Support**: Talk to close friends or family about your feelings. Sometimes just sharing your worries can alleviate some of the pressure. They might also provide encouragement and perspective. 9. **Consider Professional Help**: If your fear feels overwhelming, speaking with a counselor or therapist can provide you with tailored strategies and support. Change can be daunting, but taking those first steps, no matter how small, can eventually lead to greater confidence and a more social experience. Remember, it’s okay to take your time.

Consider reducing your time on social media or curating your feed to include positive influences. 5. **Surround Yourself with Supportive People**: Spend time with people who uplift you and appreciate you for who you are. Positive relationships can help reinforce your self-worth. 6. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself.

Sleep problems, including insomnia and even the nightmares that you are writing about, are really common for people and so many people suffer from them. Here are a few things to consider or to try: 1. Have you changed or started taking any new medication lately? Medications can certainly affect your sleep and some can even cause vivid or frightening dreams. If you are taking a new medication, talk to your provider about the nightmares, this may be the cause. 2. Stress can certainly increase our difficulty with sleep and can also begin to affect our dream states. The dreams may not make much sense, but then again even good dreams don't always make much sense. Ask yourself, do I have any new or renewed stressors in my life? Work, school, relationships, health.... all of these areas and many more are places where stress can hide out. If this is the case, talk with your provider or consider seeing a counselor who may be able to help. 3. Something to consider is that once we start to have anxiety or stress about something, we can begin to obsess about it. My guess is that going to bed for sleep is no longer a pleasant thing for you. Your stress and fear of what may happen when you sleep could start way before you actually go to bed. This could increase your chances of having another bad dream. Try relaxation techniques before going to bed. If you have YouTube, you can pull up \"Guided Meditation for Sleep\" exercises to help you relax. There are many different ones to choose from. You may also want to try deep breathing.4. There are self-help ideas for managing bad nightmares. If you Google search \"Nightmare Rescripting\" or \"Nightmare Exposure\" you may find some ideas and instructions on how to manage dreams. I hope these ideas help. Be well... Robin J.

        "text": "Hello! Thank you for your question. There are few things that people find more personal than their sexual relationships. When we feel connected to our partner, sex can be best thing since sliced bread. However, if we feel disconnected in some way, sex can feel degrading and even painful. I don’t know the specifics about your relationship or how comfortable you are in talking to your boyfriend, but this is one of those situations where communicating your fears is a good idea. The only exception to that would be if you believe he is actually a threat to you in some way. If you believe that, then you should do whatever you think is safe. It sounds like there is a part of you that is already afraid of him, and if that is the case then remaining safe is your top priority. Assuming you are able to share with him your feelings, telling him what you are and are not interested in sexually is very appropriate and sexually healthy. Sex is something that is supposed to be enjoyable for all parties. All parties should feel respected and able to say “no” to absolutely anything they are not comfortable with. I call the respectful agreement between sexual partners, “sex trust.” Sex Trust means your partner respects your boundaries. It means they won’t degrade you sexually with hurtful words, forced sex, or forcing or coercing sex in ways someone is not interested in having. Your personal safety and mental well-being is what is most important. Now, if there is a part of you that is curious about BDSM and may be interested in participating in it, there are many websites that you can explore to learn information. I will warn you, some websites and articles are better or worse than others, but you may at least feel more informed. Many people engage in BDSM and have happy relationships, but again, it completely depends on what each person in the relationship wants. It is also important to know that BDSM is not just one thing and people practice it differently based on comfort. If it is something you are uncomfortable with, then you shouldn’t feel obligated to do it. I hope this was helpful. Be well. Robin J. Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",

Be honest about how his interest in BDSM makes you feel and express your concerns. A healthy relationship should allow for open discussions about comfort levels and boundaries. 2. **Set Boundaries**: Discuss what you are comfortable with and what you are not. It's important to establish clear boundaries, especially with BDSM, where consent and communication are crucial. 3. **Educate Yourself**: Learning more about BDSM might help alleviate some of your fears. Understanding the principles of safe, sane, and consensual practices can provide a framework for a healthy exploration of interests. 4. **Take Your Time**: If you decide you want to explore BDSM, take it slow.

To decrease your anxiety symptoms it’s recommended to seek treatment with a therapist who specializes in working with anxiety disorders and most importantly one with whom you feel comfortable with.In my practice I educate clients about their anxiety and discuss building a framework with helpful tools for decreasing anxiety:1. Starting a daily mindfulness practice. For example: listening to guided meditation; engaging in deep breathing exercises; yoga practice; or other positive calming activities.2. Understand your negative and positive thoughts. Many times we tend to focus on the potential for bad things to happen. Increase positive self-talk when feeling down or when anxious. For example: \"I don't need to worry, I am calm and relaxed\". 3. Exposure to fearful or anxious situations. This can be accomplished under the care of a mental health professional. Many times we shy away from things that make us feel uncomfortable or insecure. This may led to an increase in isolating behaviors resulting in difficulty in performing things we were once able to do. For example: leaving the house; presenting in front of others; going to social events; and having conversations with people. However, the more we expose ourselves and practice the use of our positive coping skills (ex. deep breathing) the chances of anxiety will decrease. I hope this was helpful.

Navigating family dynamics can be complicated, especially when it involves multiple branches and connections.

Share your observations about how the communication issues affect her and express your feelings about the situation. It can help to let her know that you understand her frustration. 2. **Encourage Direct Communication**: If appropriate, you might encourage your uncle and aunt to communicate more directly with their son and daughter-in-law instead of bypassing them. Sometimes, families fall into habits that can be changed with a gentle nudge. 3. **Facilitate a Conversation**: If you feel comfortable, you might offer to mediate or facilitate a group conversation that includes your uncle, aunt, cousin, and his wife. This could help clear the air and encourage more direct communication moving forward. 4. **Set Boundaries**: If your mom finds it stressful to be the intermediary, it may be worth discussing boundaries—how much she wants to get involved in the communication between your uncle and cousin. 5. **Focus on Your Relationship**: While family dynamics are important, don’t forget to nurture your own relationship with your fiancé. Make sure that outside issues do not add unnecessary stress to your engagement. 6. **Stay Neutral**: Try to remain neutral and not take sides. Family politics can be sensitive, and it's often best to not get overly involved in disputes, as it can strain your relationships with both sides.

This system is responsible for regulating the heart, digestion, respiratory rate as well as other aspects which match the symptoms you describe.

The dream might be your mind's way of processing something that is difficult for you to confront. 2. **Memory and Sleep**: Sometimes, dreams are not well-remembered due to how and when you wake up. Waking up suddenly or during a deep sleep phase can impact your ability to recall dreams. The intensity of emotions might cause you to wake in a state of panic, overshadowing the details of the dream itself. 3. **Symbolism**: Dreams often operate on a symbolic level. Even if you can't remember the details, the feelings associated with the dream can provide clues about what it might represent in your waking life. ### What You Can Do: 1. **Keep a Dream Journal**: As soon as you wake up, write down anything you can remember about the dream, even if it's just a feeling or a fragment. Over time, you might start to recall more details. 2. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Consider what you were thinking or feeling leading up to the dream. Sometimes, insights into your waking life can help you connect the dots. 3. **Relaxation Techniques**: Since your dream causes panic and crying, practicing relaxation techniques like deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness before bed can help create a calmer environment for sleep. 4. **Talk About It**: Discuss your dreams and feelings with someone you trust, like a friend or family member. Sometimes, verbalizing emotions can provide clarity. 5. **Consult a Professional**: If the recurring dream and the panic it's causing are significantly distressing, it might be beneficial to talk to a therapist or counselor. They can help you explore any underlying issues. 6. **Create a Bedtime Routine**: Establishing a calm and consistent nighttime routine can help you relax and make your sleep more restful, which may facilitate better dream recall. Remember, it's normal for dreams to be elusive, and exploring these feelings in a safe way can help you find the answers or closure you might be seeking.",

Here are a few things you might find helpful: 1. **Communication**: Share your feelings with your boyfriend. Let him know how much he means to you and how being apart affects you. Open communication can strengthen your bond. 2. **Stay Connected**: Utilize technology to bridge the gap. Regular video calls, texts, or even sending surprise messages can help maintain that emotional connection. 3. **Focus on the Positive**: Remind yourself of the good moments you’ve shared and the love you have for each other. Think about the things that make your relationship special. 4. **Engage in Activities**: Distract yourself by pursuing hobbies, spending time with friends and family, or focusing on personal goals. Keeping yourself engaged can help reduce the intensity of your feelings. 5. **Plan for the Future**: Make plans to see each other again or think about how you can eventually close the distance. Having something to look forward to can make the waiting easier. 6. **Trust Your Feelings**: It’s okay to have doubts, but try to focus on the love you share. Every relationship has ups and downs, and it’s important to trust in your connection and the commitment you both have. 7. **Reflect on Your Relationship**: If you’re feeling uncertain about the future, take some time to reflect on what you want in the relationship and what steps you can take to strengthen it.

Here are some steps you might consider to help you navigate through these feelings: 1. **Communicate Openly**: It's essential to communicate with him about your feelings. Let him know you're feeling insecure, but be careful to express it in a way that doesn't come across as accusatory. For example, you might say something like, \"I've been feeling a bit insecure lately, and I just wanted to share that with you.\" This opens up a dialogue without putting him on the defensive. 2. **Reflect on Your Thoughts**: Try to identify the specific thoughts that are leading you to feel insecure. Are there particular situations or triggers? Understanding the source of your feelings can help you address them more effectively. 3. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: When you find yourself having negative thoughts about the relationship or your self-worth, actively challenge those thoughts. Ask yourself if there's real evidence to support those feelings. Often, our minds can exaggerate scenarios that aren't based in reality. 4. **Focus on Yourself**: Engage in activities that boost your self-esteem and remind you of your worth. Whether it's spending time with friends, pursuing hobbies, or focusing on personal goals, building your confidence outside of the relationship can help you feel more secure within it. 5. **Take It Slow**: It's okay to take things at your own pace. If you need time to process your feelings or establish a stronger foundation, communicate that to him. Healthy relationships develop over time, and it's important to feel comfortable. 6. **Seek Support**: Talking to friends, a family member, or even a professional can provide additional perspectives and support. Sometimes, just verbalizing your feelings can help lessen their intensity. 7. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself as you navigate these feelings. It's perfectly okay to have doubts and insecurities; what matters is how you choose to handle them. Ultimately, trust your instincts and give yourself permission to feel what you’re feeling without judgment. Take your time to build trust and confidence in both yourself and in your relationship.",

This could stem from various factors—emotional, psychological, or even situational. Here are some potential reasons and considerations: 1. **Emotional Release**: Sometimes, the urge to declutter can be linked to a need for emotional control or a desire to create a more peaceful environment. If there are underlying emotional issues or stressors in your life, this may manifest as a compulsion to throw things away. 2. **Attachment to Memories**: Objects often hold sentimental value, and the need to get rid of them might be tied to how you process memories or changes in your life. Reflecting on why certain items are significant to you may help clarify your feelings. 3. **Coping Mechanism**: For some, decluttering can serve as a coping mechanism to gain control in situations where they feel overwhelmed. It might help to identify other ways of managing stress or anxiety that don’t revolve around physical belongings. 4. **Fear of Hoarding or Clutter**: If you’ve had experiences in the past that involved clutter or hoarding, it’s possible that you’re developing a heightened sensitivity to the presence of belongings. 5. **Minimalism or Lifestyle Changes**: If you've been influenced by minimalism or lived in spaces that encourage decluttering, it may lead to increased pressure to conform to that lifestyle, resulting in anxiety when you feel you have too much. 6. **Routine or Habit**: This behavior may have developed as a habit, and habits can be hard to break. Establishing a new routine that does not involve compulsively decluttering might be beneficial. **Suggestions for Coping:** 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Journaling your thoughts and feelings around your belongings can help you understand the root of your anxiety. 2. **Set Boundaries**: Consider setting specific times or limits for decluttering. This can help manage the urge while allowing you to address it in a structured way. 3. **Talk It Out**: Speaking with a therapist or counselor could help you explore the underlying causes of your anxiety and develop strategies to cope with it. 4. **Mindfulness Techniques**: Engaging in mindfulness or relaxation exercises might help reduce anxiety and shift your focus away from your belongings. 5. **Create a “Decision Box”**: If you feel the urge to throw something away, put it in a box first. Set a time later to review it. This might help delay the decision and reduce anxiety. 6. **Focus on Purpose**: Instead of focusing on getting rid of things, try to shift the focus to the purpose they serve in your life. This might help you appreciate what you have rather than feeling overwhelmed by it. Remember, it’s okay to seek help and explore these feelings further.

Feeling powerless is something parents are wise to get used to; there's a creature in the home whose job it is to find and use their power in the family and in the world. Of course your toddler defies you, and that's healthy. I worry more about the overly compliant ones. She is wanting to know what the rules are, and all you have to do is show her clearly where the lines are. I'll give you some tips.First, remind yourself that it's her job to learn what the rules are, and where her power is. Don't be so surprised when she wants it her way. If we go through our days being ready and prepared for these beautiful creatures to have minds of their own, we're less caught off guard when it happens. Avoid situations that invite power struggles. Any time you tell your daughter \"do this now\", you set up a power struggle. The good thing is that she's young enough you can pick her up; now is the time to teach her that mom's (or dad's) word means something. So, if you say \"let's get you dressed\", then be prepared to pick her up right away and show her that when you say something will happen, you can make it happen. And I'm talking about gently picking her up here...not roughly. Pick your battles; only give instructions when you have the power to make it happen.Give her choices, so she can see her power. Instead of opening her drawer and asking what she wants to wear, give her two choices. Here's an example...she's on the ipad and you say ipad time is over. She says \"no\". You can say \"ipad time is over. If you put it down, you can play later. If I have to take it away, you don't play it later.\" The choice is hers. Then follow through.\"When...then\" statements are really helpful. Your child asks for something. Instead of saying no, try \"as soon as the toys are picked up, we can have a snack\". You're simply a pleasant parent who wants the same thing they do...but they have to earn it. Staying calm yourself is the key, because then at least you will feel in control of yourself, which is the ultimate goal. Use self-talk to calm yourself. Remind yourself her behaviour is normal and healthy. Breathe through a moment in which you would have reacted, and it will be over by the time the breath is done. You can give yourself time to think before you make parenting decisions. Time is a useful tool not enough parents use. Good luck!",

        "text": "It can be quite challenging when toddlers assert their independence, and it’s normal to feel the need for control as a parent. Here are some strategies to help you shift your approach while still guiding your toddler: 1. **Set Clear Boundaries**: Instead of feeling the need to control everything, establish a few clear and consistent boundaries. This gives your child a safe framework within which she can assert her independence. 2. **Offer Choices**: Give your toddler a sense of control by offering choices within limits. For example, you can say, “Would you like to wear the red shirt or the blue shirt?” This allows her to feel empowered while still guiding her. 3. **Pick Your Battles**: Focus on what truly matters to you and let go of less important issues. This not only reduces your need for control but also makes the important boundaries more meaningful. 4. **Positive Reinforcement**: When your toddler follows directions or makes good choices, reinforce that behavior with praise or rewards. This encourages her to respond positively to your requests. 5. **Model Calmness**: Stay calm and composed in the face of defiance. Children often mirror their parents’ emotions. If you remain calm, it may help her regulate her own reactions. 6. **Use Redirecting**: If she says no, try redirecting her attention to something else. For example, if she refuses to eat a certain vegetable, you might say, “Let’s make a funny face with our food! How about we pretend this carrot is a nose?” 7. **Empathy and Understanding**: Validate her feelings. If she says no, try saying, “I understand you don’t want to do that right now. It can be hard to stop playing.” This shows her that you are listening and acknowledging her emotions. 8. **Teach Problem-Solving**: When appropriate, involve her in solving problems instead of issuing commands. Ask her what she thinks should happen next, which can foster her autonomy while keeping her engaged. 9. **Set a Routine**: Having a consistent daily routine can help your toddler know what to expect and feel secure, which may reduce her impulses to resist. 10. **Practice Self-Care**: Take time for yourself to recharge, as parenting can be exhausting. When you feel more balanced, you may find it easier to let go of the need for control. 11. **Connect Before You Direct**: Spend a few moments connecting with your toddler before asking her to follow a direction. A short game or silly song can set a positive tone and make her more receptive. 12. **Reflect on Control**: Spend some time reflecting on your desire for control. Consider what is driving it and whether it stems from fear, anxiety, or external pressures. Recognizing these emotions can help you let go. Remember, toddlers are in a stage of testing boundaries and seeking independence. Patience and understanding can go a long way in creating a trusting and responsive relationship between you and your child.",

        "text": "Hi Winters, I'm so glad you wrote, because I think there are a lot of young women experiencing the exact same thing. You feel self-loathing for both being a virgin, and for being sexually active. Young women have always gotten crazy mixed messages about what they're supposed to be. They feel pressure to be pure, and they also feel pressure to be the vixen and please men sexually. But you can't be both, so you can't ever win if you buy into all that horse manure (excuse my language). This current hook-up culture puts added pressure on girls to expect nothing more than random sexual encounters that leave you feeling empty and used; perhaps desirable in that moment but mostly worthless. The stupid part is that research tells us that young men are also impacted negatively by this cultural norm that values sex and not relationship; they feel guilt, and loneliness. I urge you to talk to other girls and women about your feelings. My hope and prayer is that they will echo my words here.Your value and power cannot ever be found in whether a man wants you, whether you turn his eye, or how he treats you. Your sexuality is a beautiful part of who you are, and it is to be celebrated. I love that you want to celebrate it with someone who cares. Who you are is so very much more than your sexuality. You sound like you have a lot of things going for you. Try to see all of those things when you think of yourself.There are many more virgins out there, and many are afraid, like you, that they don't fit in. We are all different, and you don't have to be anything but who you want to be; who you are. You don't have to have any kind of sex until you're ready, and that makes you brave and smart, not weird.You're tall and beautiful, and guys may be intimidated by that. It may take time for you to meet the right guy, but he's out there. The question is: How do you want to spend your time until he crosses your path? I hope you talk to someone soon and find out that your feelings are normal. I wish you the best.",

        "text": "It's completely understandable to feel anxious and self-critical about your experiences, especially when societal pressures and comparisons come into play. First, it's essential to recognize that everyone's journey is unique; there's no \"right\" timeline for relationships, intimacy, or personal experiences. Many people struggle with feelings of inadequacy, especially in their late teens and early twenties, and you're certainly not alone in feeling this way. Here are a few points to consider that might help you navigate your feelings and experiences: 1. **Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. It's normal to have feelings of self-doubt, but try to shift your focus from what you think you \"should\" be doing to what feels right and comfortable for you. Your worth isn’t defined by your relationship status or sexual experiences. 2. **Quality over Quantity**: It's clear that you wish to have meaningful connections. Focus on building friendships and engaging in social activities that interest you. This can lead to genuine relationships. Genuine connections often develop when you are engaged in activities you love and where you feel comfortable. 3. **Pressure and Expectations**: Understand that societal norms can often create unnecessary pressure. It’s okay to prioritize your values and beliefs about relationships and intimacy. There’s no need to rush into anything that doesn’t align with what you truly want. 4. **Explore Yourself First**: Reflect on what you truly desire in a partner and a relationship. Prioritizing your needs and values can help you make better decisions in the future, and it may alleviate some feelings of pressure or anxiety. 5. **Seek Support**: If you're feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a friend or a mental health professional. Sometimes, expressing yourself and sharing feelings can provide relief and help you gain perspective. 6. **Focus on Personal Growth**: Use this time in university to invest in yourself—pursue hobbies, try new things, and focus on personal development. Relationships often blossom when you're at your best self. 7. **Be Open to Connections**: Sometimes, feelings of anxiety can create barriers to social interactions. Try to be open and approachable, and don’t hesitate to take the initiative to connect with others, whether that's through joining clubs, attending events, or simply starting conversations. 8. **Set Boundaries**: It's okay to say no to experiences that make you uncomfortable. If the casual encounters you engaged in didn't leave you feeling good, remind yourself that it's perfectly okay to wait for someone special who shares your values and intentions. Ultimately, prioritize what feels right for you and remember that your self-worth goes far beyond your romantic experiences. Building a fulfilling life can lead you to the connections you’re looking for, and in the right timing, love and relationships often follow.",

Despite what most people think of when they hear the word assertive, assertive communication is one of the best ways to manage interpersonal conflict as well as maintain personal boundaries. Once we become comfortable with acknowledging our boundaries, there is usually a follow-up whereby we realize that we have the right to those boundaries. In effect, assertiveness communication becomes it's own self-motivating force in managing positive self-esteem. You may want to invest in a workbook that can help you to develop these skills on your own, or work directly with a therapist to develop them in a safe situation. One of the Workbooks that I have found to be very helpful is, \"The Assertiveness Workbook: How to Express your Ideas and Stand Up for Yourself at Work and in Relationships\" by Randy J Paterson.",

Change is absolutely possible, even if it feels daunting. Here are some steps to consider that might help you on your journey toward greater confidence and self-acceptance: 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to recognize and accept how you are feeling without judgment. These feelings of insecurity and anxiety are valid and stem from your experiences. 2. **Seek Professional Support**: A therapist or counselor can provide valuable tools and strategies for dealing with anxiety and self-esteem issues. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), for instance, can help you challenge negative thought patterns and build confidence. 3. **Set Small, Achievable Goals**: Start with small social situations where you feel slightly uncomfortable but safe. This could be something as simple as making small talk with a coworker or speaking up in a meeting. Gradually, as you become more comfortable, you can push yourself a bit further. 4. **Develop Assertiveness**: Being assertive doesn’t mean being aggressive; it’s about expressing your thoughts, feelings, and needs openly and honestly. There are many resources, including books and workshops, that focus on building assertiveness skills. 5. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Treat yourself with kindness and understanding. Recognize that everyone has insecurities and that it's okay to feel vulnerable. Practicing self-compassion can help reduce anxiety and build resilience. 6. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: Pay attention to your inner dialogue. When a negative thought arises, challenge it. Ask yourself if it’s really true or if there’s another way to look at the situation. 7. **Connect with Supportive People**: Surround yourself with people who uplift you and encourage you. This can help create a more positive environment that eases your anxiety. 8. **Engage in Activities You Enjoy**: Pursuing hobbies or interests can help build your confidence and provide a distraction from anxious thoughts. Consider joining clubs or groups where you can meet like-minded individuals. 9. **Mindfulness and Relaxation Techniques**: Practices like meditation, yoga, or deep-breathing exercises can help manage anxiety and improve your overall emotional well-being. 10. **Keep a Journal**: Writing can be a powerful tool for self-reflection. Consider documenting your feelings, experiences, and growth over time. This can help you recognize patterns and celebrate your progress. 11. **Educate Yourself**: Read books and resources about personal development, social skills, and overcoming anxiety. Understanding these concepts can empower you to change. 12. **Limit Social Comparison**: Try to minimize the time spent comparing yourself to others, especially on social media. Focus on your own journey and acknowledge the progress you are making. Remember, change takes time, and it's normal to have setbacks along the way. Be patient with yourself and celebrate small victories as you work towards a more confident and fulfilling life. You are already taking a significant step by seeking help and wanting to change, and that's worth acknowledging.",

They can help diagnose any potential issues and suggest appropriate treatments or strategies. 2. **Track Your Symptoms**: Keeping a journal of your sleep patterns, mood changes, and triggers for anxiety can provide valuable information to share with a professional.

It’s clear that you’ve done a lot of soul-searching and that you recognize the cycle of frustration and anxiety you’re experiencing isn’t healthy for you. Here are some steps to consider as you navigate this decision: 1. **Reflect on Your Needs**: Take some time to write down what you want in a partner and a relationship. Consider everything from daily communication to shared experiences and long-term goals. This clarity might help reinforce your feelings about the relationship. 2. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's natural to feel anxiety and depression at the thought of separating from someone you’ve been with for a long time, especially with concerns about loneliness or not finding someone else. Allow yourself to feel these emotions without judgment, and remind yourself that they are temporary. 3. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends or a therapist about your feelings. Sometimes, having an outside perspective can help you process your emotions more clearly and provide the support you need to make the best choice for yourself. 4. **Practice Mindfulness**: Techniques such as meditation or deep-breathing exercises can help manage your anxiety and stay grounded in the present moment. This might make it easier to cope with the feelings that arise as you consider ending the relationship. 5. **Prepare for the Transition**: If you decide to end things, think about practical steps to make the transition smoother. This may involve planning how to communicate your decision, setting boundaries, and creating a support system for yourself during the change. 6. **Give Yourself Time**: After ending a long-term relationship, it’s perfectly normal to feel a range of emotions, including grief and uncertainty about the future. Allow yourself time to heal and rediscover what you want for yourself before jumping into something new. 7. **Consider the Long-Term**: Remind yourself that staying in a relationship that doesn’t meet your needs can hinder your chance of finding the companionship and presence you truly desire. Ending it may open the door to healthier relationships in the future. Ultimately, it’s important to honor your needs and desires for a fulfilling relationship. You deserve to be with someone who prioritizes you and shares your vision for the future. Making the decision to end a relationship is never easy, but it can also be an opportunity for growth and finding a deeper connection in the future.",

Many outgoing people have moments when they feel uncertain about what to say or simply don't want to engage in conversation.

Well, that is an easy question. I would spend it with my family! Easier said than done when we are living in a tomorrow kind of World, right? Its hard to focus on the now when we are so consumed in what tomorrow shall bring.Time management is a very important factor when learning to \"live life to the fullest\"! In fact, this is a required course in undergraduate college now. Everyone manages their time differently and it is up to you to decide how you would like to do this. Personally, for myself I like to keep a calendar with a to-do list. I always place my most important tasks at the top of the list. That way, if I do not get through the list, I am not stressing over the little things. When planning your day, it is important you schedule work, eat and play. A much as it is hard not to work after getting off work, it must be done. There is discipline involved in this process. If you have trouble with this, then maybe seeking out some accountability such as including a coworker to make sure you do not bring work home once your shift is over or your spouse/partner reminding you that this is a time for play and not work.These are just some ideas that I am throwing out there.

Several factors can contribute to this sensation: 1. **Routine and Repetition**: When days feel similar and routine, our brains don't register them as vividly, making time feel like it's passing more quickly. 2. **Age Perception**: As we get older, each year becomes a smaller fraction of our life, which can make it feel like time is speeding up. 3. **Life Events**: Significant life changes or transitions can create a sense of time moving faster, especially as we reflect on past experiences. 4. **Digital Distractions**: The constant connection through devices can fragment our attention, making it hard to fully engage with the present moment.

Try self-care activities that make you feel good about yourself. 5. **Limit Exposure to Negativity**: If conversations with your dad tend to make you feel worse, consider limiting those interactions or preparing responses that calmly express your desire for support instead of criticism. 6. **Explore Coping Mechanisms**: Look into various coping strategies such as mindfulness, meditation, or physical exercise. These can help manage anxiety and build self-confidence over time. 7. **Educate Your Family**: If you feel comfortable, consider sharing resources about anxiety and mental health with your family. Sometimes, people don’t understand how to respond because they lack knowledge about these issues. 8. **Identify Triggers**: Try to understand what specifically triggers your anxiety, body image issues, and feelings of worthlessness. Awareness can empower you to find ways to cope better in those situations. 9. **Plan for Social Events**: If attending parties or dinners is necessary, plan ahead. Think about what you can do if you start to feel anxious. Having an exit strategy can help you feel more in control. 10. **Consider Future Therapy**: If possible, keep an eye out for opportunities for professional help in the future, even if it's not something you can pursue right now. Therapy can be life-changing and provide the support you need. Remember, it’s important to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health.

Certain anxiety medications can make you feel nauseous, but I haven't heard of any that cause mouth blisters, so there may be some other underlying medical issue there. I would definitely talk to your primary care physician and whoever has prescribed the medication as well as a neurologist if you've suffered a severe head injury. There are so many medications available for anxiety or insomnia or even depression that there may be others with lesser side effects.But beyond that, have you tried any other treatments such as deep breathing or meditation? Meditation can be very effective, but it takes practice and you don't have to sit cross-legged for hours chanting \"Ohm\" to meditate. It's about focusing on your breath, rather than all the thoughts that are racing through your head. And when they do take your mind off your breath, simply refocus (and refocus and refocus). Like I said, it takes practice, so don't give up. You can find many sites offering different ways to meditate, so look around and see what works best for you.

Here are some thoughts on how to proceed: 1. **Assess Your Feelings**: Take some time to reflect on your feelings regarding your ex-wife and the current situation. Acknowledge any pain or anger but also consider your child's well-being. 2. **Focus on the Child’s Needs**: Your child’s emotional and psychological health should be the priority. Frequent and positive interactions can offer love and stability, but it's crucial to consider how those interactions are framed by your ex. If seeing your child too frequently leads to conflict or manipulation from your ex, it might complicate things for both you and your child. 3. **Establish Boundaries**: Set clear boundaries with your ex-wife about your role as a parent. Having clear communication and a structured parenting plan can reduce confusion and ensure that your child knows they are loved by both parents. 4. **Quality Over Quantity**: It may be more beneficial to focus on quality time spent with your child rather than the frequency of visits. When you do see your child, make those moments count by being fully present, engaging in activities they enjoy, and fostering a nurturing relationship. 5. **Keep Communication Open**: Depending on their age, maintain an open line of communication with your child. Let them know you care about them, and encourage them to express their feelings about the situation. 6. **Seek Support**: This journey can be emotionally taxing. Consider speaking with a therapist or counselor who can help you process your feelings and provide strategies to cope with the situation. They can also assist in deciding how to maintain a relationship with your child. 7. **Focus on Yourself**: As you try to move on and not dwell on the past, invest time in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Building a fulfilling life outside of this relationship can help in healing and moving forward. 8. **Legal Considerations**: If you believe your ex-wife is using the child as a pawn, it may be advisable to consult with a legal professional regarding custody and visitation rights to ensure that your relationship with your child is protected.

Here are some strategies to help balance the needs of the child with autism while still addressing the concerns of the other campers: 1. **Education and Awareness**: Consider having a brief, age-appropriate discussion with all the campers about autism and different ways people learn and interact. Helping them understand that everyone has unique challenges can foster empathy and acceptance. 2. **Emphasize Inclusion**: Find opportunities to involve other campers in activities with the child. This could be games, art projects, or group activities where everyone can participate together. It may help other kids see him as a friend rather than someone who needs to be treated differently. 3. **Set Clear Expectations**: Make sure that all the campers know the rules and what behaviors are expected. Reinforce that we all have different needs and some children may require extra support. 4. **Use Visual Aids**: Besides cards to keep the child with autism engaged, consider using visual schedules or charts that can also be utilized by all campers. This may help them see that everyone collaborates to create a positive environment. 5. **Positive Reinforcement**: Celebrate and acknowledge behaviors from all campers when they show understanding or kindness towards their peer. This can help promote a supportive atmosphere. 6. **Model Calmness and Patience**: Continue to model calm behavior when interacting with the child. Over time, other campers may learn to emulate this behavior, creating a more peaceful environment. 7. **Structured Activities**: Implement structured activities that cater to various skill levels.

The \"recipe\" is easy - say what you are doing/going to do; do only that unless change is necessary, in which case you inform others involved, and repeat. And cut yourself some slack. Your mom will recover and so will you. It's an important and painful lesson about integrity, but once learned it will serve you well.",

Here are some steps you can consider taking to begin addressing the situation: 1. **Reflect on the Situation**: Take some time to understand what led to the loss of trust. Acknowledging your actions and their impact is an important step. 2. **Give Her Space**: It might be beneficial to give her some space to process her feelings. Respecting her need for distance can be an important part of the healing process. 3. **Communicate Openly**: When the time feels right, try to have an open and honest conversation. Apologize sincerely for your actions and express your feelings without being defensive. 4. **Take Responsibility**: Own your part in the situation. Acknowledging your mistakes can help her see that you're committed to changing and rebuilding trust. 5. **Be Patient**: Trust takes time to rebuild. Understand that she may need time to process her emotions and feelings. 6. **Work on Yourself**: Reflect on what led to the breach of trust and identify ways to improve. This can be through self-growth, therapy, or other avenues that help you understand yourself better. 7. **Seek Support**: Talk to friends or a counselor about how you’re feeling. Sometimes, expressing your feelings can provide comfort and guidance. 8. **Show Consistency**: If she’s open to it, demonstrate through your actions that you’re working to regain her trust. Consistency over time can help rebuild what has been broken. Remember, healing takes time, both for you and for the person you hurt. Be kind to yourself during this process.",

Here are some steps you might consider taking to try and communicate more effectively and support her: 1. **Choose the Right Time and Place**: Find a calm and private moment to approach her when she isn’t preoccupied or overwhelmed. Make sure she feels safe and secure, as this can facilitate better communication. 2. **Use \"I\" Statements**: Share your feelings without sounding accusatory. For example, say, “I feel worried when I see you so tired and isolated,” rather than, “You need to get out of your room.” 3. **Listen Actively**: Encourage her to share her thoughts and feelings. Show empathy and validate her experiences. Sometimes just knowing someone is willing to listen can open up communication. 4. **Avoid Pressure**: Instead of suggesting solutions right away, try to express your concern without pushing her to change. Let her take the lead in expressing what she might need or how she feels. 5. **Offer Support**: Let her know that you are there for her and are willing to help in whatever way she feels comfortable. Whether that's going for a walk, talking to a professional, or just spending time together doing something she enjoys. 6. **Encourage Professional Help**: Gently suggest the idea of talking to a healthcare professional or therapist. Emphasize that seeking help is a sign of strength and that it can provide her with additional support. 7. **Educate Yourself**: If possible, learn about signs of depression or other mental health issues. This can help you understand what she might be experiencing and how best to communicate with her. 8. **Be Patient**: Change takes time, especially when someone is struggling. Your consistent support can be crucial, even if it seems like she’s not receptive right now. 9. **Maintain Your Own Well-Being**: While it’s important to support her, don’t forget to take care of yourself. Seek out support for yourself as well if you are feeling overwhelmed. Ultimately, your compassion and willingness to be there for her may help her feel less alone and more open to change in the future.",

        "text": "A lot depends on the age of your child, but given that it was a mis-used debit card, I am going to guess he's a teen? Assuming that, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind...1. That he lied about the misuse indicates he knows he was in the wrong. That's a dreadful feeling - getting caught out- and an impulsive lie may have popped out of his mouth before he thought it through (after all a debit spend is pretty easy to track). 2. Once he lied he stuck with the lie. Somewhere along the line, even though he knew that you knew he wasn't telling the truth, he stuck with his story. And as you said, it's not the first time he lied. Now it looks like a habit has formed.Going forward, when there is a dishonest act of any kind, it's essential that you set it up so your son can be truthful. Simply put, do not ask questions. If you know for certain that he has, for example, misused your debit card, say so. Asking \"did you\" invites him to get creative with denial; asking \"why did you\" implies that, with a good enough reason, he might not be in hot water with you. Instead, say what is: \"I see this charge on my debit card and realize you used it without my permission\". (You can only do this if you know for sure it was him but it sounds like you do). If he meets with denial, stay calm, restate that you are aware this happened. Then deliver consequences that match the transgression (he has to return the item if it's returnable or find a way to pay you back for the charge as well as any fees incurred in using it). Make it harder to find your card because he isn't that great at curbing the impulse to use it yet.And most importantly, once the consequence is delivered you have to let it go. Continuing to bring it up won't benefit him, but it does have the potential to make him more sneaky. Every time he asks respectfully to use it, whether you allow him to or not, be sure to praise him for asking nicely. \"Catch\" him doing it right as often as possible.Hang in there - this isn't super unusual behavior but it isn't acceptable, so address it but don't let yourself get too wound up about it.",

Addressing issues of trust and honesty, especially regarding stealing and lying, can be complex. Here are some steps you might consider: 1. **Stay Calm and Understand**: Take a moment to collect your thoughts before addressing the situation. It’s important to approach your son calmly to avoid escalating tensions. Try to understand why he felt the need to steal your debit card. Sometimes, underlying issues like peer pressure, self-esteem issues, or emotional struggles can lead to such behavior. 2. **Open a Dialogue**: Have a candid conversation with him about the incident. Instead of approaching it with anger or punishment, ask open-ended questions that encourage him to share his feelings. For example, \"Can you help me understand what made you take my card?\" Emphasize that it's safe for him to be honest with you. 3. **Discuss Consequences**: It's important he understands the seriousness of his actions. Explain why stealing is wrong and discuss logical consequences related to the behavior—like making amends for what he did. This could be through helping with chores, doing extra work around the house, or contributing to paying back any money spent. 4. **Establish Trust and Boundaries**: Talk about the importance of honesty in your relationship. Set clear expectations regarding trust and boundaries going forward. You might want to consider involving him in developing a plan on how he can regain your trust. 5. **Professional Support**: If this behavior continues, it may be helpful to seek guidance from a counselor or therapist. They can provide support for both you and your son and help him work through any underlying issues contributing to his behavior. 6. **Model Honest Behavior**: Make sure that you are modeling the behavior you want to see. Demonstrating honesty and openness in your own communications and actions can inspire him to adopt the same values. 7. **Monitor and Follow Up**: Give him a chance to show he can be responsible, and keep the lines of communication open. After some time, revisit the topic to see how he’s feeling and discuss his progress regarding trust and honesty. Remember, building trust and teaching values take time and consistency. It’s important to be patient as you work through this together.",

Toe walking, especially if it's a new behavior, can sometimes indicate underlying issues such as sensory processing differences, developmental changes, or even stress. As for the messy writing and coloring, this could be associated with a variety of factors, including motor skill development or emotional changes. Here are some steps you might consider: 1. **Talk to Her**: Have an open and supportive conversation with your daughter. Ask her how she feels about her writing and coloring, and if there’s any reason for the change in her walking style. Sometimes children can articulate feelings or experiences that might help explain the changes. 2. **Observe**: Keep an eye on her walking habits and writing over the course of a few days or weeks. Note any other potential changes in behavior, mood, or activity level. 3. **Consult a Professional**: If the behaviors persist or if you have serious concerns, it may be best to consult a pediatrician or a specialist. They can evaluate her for any potential physical, neurological, or developmental issues and may refer you to a physical therapist, occupational therapist, or psychologist if necessary. 4. **Consider Environmental Factors**: Reflect on whether there have been any significant changes in her life recently (new school, friendships, family dynamics) that could contribute to her stress or anxiety. 5. **Encourage Activities**: Providing opportunities for her to engage in activities that promote fine motor skills, such as arts and crafts, could help improve her writing and coloring. 6. **Provide Support**: Ensure she has your support in managing any feelings of anxiety or frustration that may arise from these changes. Remember that many children go through phases that involve changes in behavior, but it's always a good idea to err on the side of caution and seek professional advice if you're concerned.",

Your feelings are certainly valid, and many parents go through phases where they connect more deeply with some children than others, particularly when the youngest child is still very young and dependent. At one year old, the youngest child may require a lot of attention and care, which can be overwhelming, especially when you have older children who may be more independent and able to engage in different activities. It can also be challenging to form that bond when you're still in the early stages of parenting with the youngest. However, it's important to recognize these feelings and reflect on them. Building a bond with the youngest child may take time, and it's okay to be in a different place emotionally right now. Consider spending one-on-one time with her during play or bonding activities to help strengthen your connection. This could also be an opportunity to reflect on your feelings and seek support or resources if you feel it's necessary.

While each individual's response can vary based on numerous factors, including resilience, support systems, and personal coping strategies, common potential long-term effects might include: 1. **Attachment Issues**: Adults with such backgrounds may struggle with forming secure attachments. They might experience difficulties in trusting others, have fear of abandonment, or develop anxious or avoidant attachment styles in relationships. 2. **Mental Health Challenges**: This history may increase the risk of developing mental health issues, such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, or complex PTSD, especially related to traumatic experiences in childhood. 3. **Low Self-Esteem and Self-Worth**: Experiences of abandonment and abuse can lead to a negative self-image, with feelings of worthlessness or inadequacy being prevalent. 4. **Difficulty Regulating Emotions**: Adults might find it challenging to manage and express emotions appropriately, potentially leading to mood swings, emotional instability, or difficulties coping with stress. 5. **Interpersonal Relationship Issues**: There may be persistent difficulties in relationships, including codependency, fear of intimacy, or patterns of engaging in unhealthy relationships, echoing past abusive dynamics. 6. **Trust Issues**: Given the instability and betrayal experienced, individuals may struggle to trust others, impacting personal and professional relationships. 7. **Substance Abuse**: Some may turn to drugs, alcohol, or other addictive behaviors as a way to cope with their unresolved trauma and emotional pain. 8. **Challenges with Parenting**: Adults with such a history might have fears about their parenting abilities, potentially avoiding having children altogether or repeating unhealthy patterns from their childhood. 9. **Coping Strategies**: This history can lead some individuals to develop unhealthy coping strategies as a means of survival, including avoidance, suppression of emotions, or engaging in risky behaviors. 10. **Resilience and Growth**: On a more positive note, individuals may also develop resilience, empathy, and a strong desire to break the cycle of trauma, potentially leading to personal growth, advocacy for others, or a commitment to creating a stable environment for themselves and their loved ones. It is important for individuals with such a childhood history to seek support, whether through therapy, support groups, or other resources, to process their experiences and develop healthier coping mechanisms. Each person's journey is unique, and with appropriate support, many can work towards healing and building fulfilling lives.",

I have worked with a number of young adults in their 20's who have had to move back home after college , or even stay at home through the college years. Bottom line is that either way , it is so difficult when you are trying to discover who you are and what you want your life to be , to have to live at home. I have even heard much older adults clients say that when they visit their childhood home , they suddenly feel like a \"kid\" again . The old dynamics between adults and their parents and siblings can pop right up as if they have gone back in time and are no longer adults !I would suggest that you approach your mom and say something like \"I am hoping we can talk about the best way for us to manage me living here. I really appreciate that you are giving me a place to live until I get on my feet , and I want to be respectful of you and our home ; at the same time , though, I feel like it's important for me to have more independence than when I was younger because I am growing up and trying to learn more about myself and become more autonomous. Can we talk about what might be fair rules that we can both live with ?\" If she is receptive , maybe you can each write a separate list of what you think would be fair and reasonable and then compare lists and try to make compromises and come up with a list of \"guidleines\" that feel fair to you both . If this is too hard to do alone , perhaps you and your mom can meet with a therapist a few times who can help you to come up with some kind of \"compromise contract.\" This is not an easy situation , but if you can approach your mom in a calm and \"mature\" way and suggest a planned, structured discussion that doesn't take place in the heat of the moment , your mom may be impressed by your maturity and even more receptive to working out some rules that you can both live with.Good luck !!Elissa Gross",

Here are some steps you might consider: 1. **Communicate Openly**: Have a calm, honest conversation with your mother about how you feel. Express your desire for more independence and discuss how her rules affect your life. It’s important to communicate your feelings without sounding confrontational. 2. **Set Boundaries**: Determine which aspects of her rules you find most restrictive and discuss why you believe certain freedoms should be allowed. Setting boundaries is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship. 3. **Understand Her Perspective**: Try to see things from your mother’s point of view. She may have concerns about your safety, well-being, or lifestyle choices. Understanding her motivations can help guide the conversation. 4. **Negotiate**: Work together to find a compromise. Perhaps you can propose a trial period for more independence or suggest rules that work for both of you. 5. **Demonstrate Responsibility**: Show that you can be responsible and make good decisions. This might involve managing your finances, contributing to household chores, or pursuing your goals. Demonstrating maturity can build trust and help you gain more autonomy. 6. **Plan for Independence**: Start developing a plan to move out. This might include saving money, looking for a job with better pay, or exploring shared living situations with friends to reduce costs. 7. **Seek Support**: Talk to a friend, family member, or counselor about what you’re experiencing. They might offer insights or strategies based on their own experiences. 8. **Know When to Stand Firm**: If the control becomes too stifling and affects your mental health or happiness, consider standing firm on your needs, even if it means difficult conversations. 9. **Consider Professional Help**: If discussions remain unproductive, family therapy can be an option. A neutral third party can facilitate healthier communication. Remember, it takes time to adjust to new dynamics in family relationships.

Here are some steps you can consider taking to approach this difficult conversation: 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Before talking to your dad, take some time to think about why you want to live with your mom. Write down your feelings and specific reasons, as this might help you articulate your thoughts more clearly when you speak with him. 2. **Choose the Right Time and Place**: Timing and environment can significantly affect the outcome of a conversation. Try to find a calm moment when your dad isn't stressed or preoccupied. A quiet, private setting may help both of you feel more comfortable discussing your feelings. 3. **Be Honest and Calm**: When you talk to your dad, express your feelings honestly but calmly. Use \"I\" statements to explain how you feel (e.g., \"I feel more comfortable with my mom\" instead of \"You make me feel bad about wanting to be with her\"). This can help keep the conversation focused on your feelings rather than accusations. 4. **Listen to His Perspective**: Allow your dad to share his feelings and worries too. It’s important to show that you want to understand his viewpoint, even if you don’t agree with it. 5. **Discuss Your Needs**: Explain what you need from him and your situation. Emphasize that your desire to live with your mom is not about rejecting him but about what feels right for you. 6. **Seek Guidance**: If you think the conversation might escalate or be particularly difficult, consider involving a trusted adult, such as a family member, counselor, or teacher, who can help mediate the discussion. 7. **Prepare for Different Outcomes**: Understand that your dad may react in a variety of ways, and it may take time for him to process your feelings. Be prepared for this and try to stay calm, even if the conversation is challenging. 8. **Consider Your Safety**: If you feel threatened or unsafe in any way, it's very important to reach out for help from someone you trust, like a family member, teacher, or counselor. Remember that it's okay to have these feelings, and wanting to live with your mom is valid.

It's important to remember that addiction is a complex issue that often involves many factors, and it's not solely about any one person's actions. Here are a few steps you might consider taking to support yourself and your family: 1. **Seek Professional Help:** It might be beneficial for you and your children to see a therapist or counselor who specializes in addiction and family dynamics. They can provide support and strategies to help everyone cope with the situation. 2. **Open Communication:** Try to create a safe space for open and honest communication. While it might be difficult, letting your children express their feelings without judgment can help.

If the child is considered an \"adult\" by state law with regard to counseling (states differ on this - the range is typically between age 13 and age 18), no one is allowed to be in the session without the child's consent.Second, ethical and legal standards generally require that a counselor be in the role of a therapist, or in the role of an evaluator, but not both. This means that a counselor should not generally provide both counseling and offer an opinion regarding who should have custody of a child.Third, knowing the details of any parenting plan or separation agreement is important. Generally, either parent can consent to counseling for a minor child and can be present during the child’s sessions. If a court order, parenting plan, or separation agreement specifies that one of the parents has sole decision making authority, then only that parent can consent to counseling for the minor child and only that parent can be present during the child’s sessions.In a situation like this I would strongly recommend seeking out legal advice specific to your state law.",

If a parent encourages a child to divulge details in order to build a case for custody, it raises concerns about the influence on the child and the potential for creating conflict between the parents. This behavior can be harmful to the child's well-being and may also violate legal or professional standards for counseling. If there are custody disputes or concerns regarding a child's safety, it is advisable for parents to work through the legal system and seek appropriate professional guidance rather than using informal methods to gather information.

It may not necessarily be a defiant behavior; it can be an issue of awareness and self-regulation. 2. **Set Reminders**: Encourage him to take regular breaks during his gaming or video-watching sessions. Setting a timer to remind him to get up and use the bathroom might help. 3. **Establish a Routine**: Encourage a regular bathroom schedule. For instance, encourage him to use the bathroom at specific times throughout the day, such as before starting a gaming session or every couple of hours during longer sessions. 4. **Communicate Openly**: Discuss the situation with him in a non-punitive manner. Ask how he feels during these instances and whether he realizes when he needs to go. Understanding his perspective is crucial for finding solutions. 5. **Evaluate Triggers**: Besides gaming, assess if there are other triggers leading to this behavior. Stress, anxiety, or changes in routine might also contribute. 6. **Consult a Professional**: If the behavior persists, consider consulting a healthcare professional or a child psychologist.

It sounds like you are going through a challenging time, and it's understandable to seek clarity about your identity. Here are some steps you could consider: 1. **Find Supportive Communities**: Seek out support groups or online communities for transgender individuals. Connecting with people who have similar experiences can help you feel less alone and provide guidance. 2. **Speak to a Professional**: It's great that you recognize the importance of professional help. Look for a therapist or counselor who specializes in gender identity and transgender issues. They can provide a safe space for you to explore your feelings and options. 3. **Educate Yourself**: Learn more about gender identity, the experiences of transgender people, and the steps involved in transitioning. Understanding more about your feelings can empower you. 4. **Consider Safe Options for Transition**: If you're thinking about transitioning, there may be safe pathways to explore, such as changing your name or pronouns, or experimenting with gender expression through clothing and hairstyles. 5. **Be Cautious with Substances**: It's crucial to refrain from taking any hormones or medications without medical supervision. This can be unsafe and may have long-term health implications. A healthcare provider can guide you through options for hormone therapy if that's something you're considering. 6. **Plan for Conversations with Family**: If you feel safe doing so, consider finding ways to communicate your feelings with your family. This can be difficult, especially if they hold negative views, but being open about your identity may eventually lead to understanding. 7. **Explore Legal and Medical Resources**: If you decide to pursue medical transition in the future, look into the processes for getting guidance on hormone therapy or surgery from qualified medical professionals. 8. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Allow yourself to feel your emotions and be gentle with yourself. Self-acceptance takes time, and it’s okay to seek help on this journey. Remember, your feelings are valid, and taking steps to understand yourself and move toward becoming your true self is important. Take things one step at a time, and prioritize your mental and emotional well-being.",

        "text": "It's completely understandable to feel stuck at times, especially when you're in a creative field like filmmaking where the path can often be uncertain and challenging. Here are some suggestions that might help you navigate this period and unlock more of your potential: 1. **Self-Reflection**: Take some time to reflect on what specifically makes you feel stuck. Is it related to your career, personal relationships, or a combination of factors? Journaling can be a helpful tool for this. 2. **Set Clear Goals**: Establish specific, actionable goals for both your filmmaking career and personal life. Break them down into smaller, manageable steps that you can work on consistently. 3. **Expand Your Network**: Filmmaking is a collaborative art. Attend workshops, film festivals, or networking events to meet others in the industry. Building relationships can lead to opportunities you might not find otherwise. 4. **Explore New Projects**: Sometimes focusing on a different type of project or experimenting with new styles can reignite your passion and creativity. Consider working on short films, documentaries, or even collaborating with others. 5. **Seek Mentorship**: Find someone in the industry whose work you admire and reach out for guidance. A mentor can provide valuable insights, feedback, and encouragement. 6. **Personal Development**: Since you’re already meditating, consider integrating other self-improvement practices such as reading, attending workshops, or studying filmmaking techniques that interest you. This can not only enhance your skills but also boost your confidence. 7. **Open Up to Relationships**: Consider what a serious relationship means to you and what the barriers might be. Engaging in social activities or joining groups that share your interests can help you meet new people in a more relaxed environment. 8. **Stay Patient**: Recognize that growth takes time, and setbacks can be part of the journey. Celebrate small victories and stay committed to your goals. 9. **Professional Help**: If feelings of being stuck persist, you might benefit from talking to a therapist or counselor who can help you explore these feelings more deeply. 10. **Practice Gratitude**: Developing a gratitude practice can shift your focus from what's lacking to what you have, making it easier to see opportunities. Remember, everyone’s journey has its ups and downs. Embrace where you are now as part of your unique story.",

        "text": "Hello, and thank you for your question. Guilt is one of those things that nearly everyone has experienced at one time or another, and it can feel like a huge weight around your neck. Unfortunately, it is unlikely that we can give you some words of wisdom that will make it all go away. However, I will give you some ideas and hopefully this will help.One of the things that we know about guilt is that it doesn't usually do much to help us in the long-run. People may make changes for a short-term period of time because they feel guilty about something they did, but usually they will go back to their old behaviors if they don't have something else to help them change permanently, such as a new skill. So, guilt doesn't necessarily help us. In fact, as I write this someone out there is eating an entire key lime pie because they feel guilty about falling off their diet. Someone may be drinking alcohol because they feel guilty about drinking alcohol. For whatever reason, this is just a common thing that we do. Now accountability is different than guilt. Accountability can actually be constructive. When you hold yourself accountable you can admit that you have done something wrong. That it hurt others and you deeply regret it. That you are prepared to take steps to make sure it doesn't happen again. That you have done what you can to make amends, if necessary. That you are sorry. And then you move on. Why is moving on necessary? Well, for one thing, it doesn't usually help the people who you hurt. In fact, someone's guilty behavior may serve to remind the people who were hurt, over and over again, about what happened. Guilt is usually 100% about us, and not about those we hurt. Also, guilt can lead us to behave in ways that may even hurt people more. Having said all of that, guilt is a normal human emotion. Sometimes we experience it for a while and it goes away. Sometimes we need help to work through it. There are many self-help books about forgiving yourself. You can try Amazon to find some, or consider getting help from a counselor. Be well,Robin Landwehr, DBH, LPC, NCC",

Allow yourself to feel your emotions, but also consider seeking support from friends, family, or a mental health professional who can help you process these feelings.

That is, I forget how good things can turn bad. Personally, to avoid this emotional roller-coaster, I try and heed the famous advice by author and feminist Rita Mae Brown: \"One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.\"So maybe this weakness of your for forgetting is really a strength! It sounds a lot like living in the moment to me. And while it’s hard to manage my past and my future, the moment seems like a small enough piece of temporal real estate to sort out. So that’s the “what” of my answer. The “how” goes like this: Choose one from column A, two from column B, and three from column C in the following chart. Then try doing them for as long as you can. Then see what happens.A B CGratitude Forgiveness AppreciationExpectations Meditation ExerciseBitterness Distraction Volunteering Resentment Substances WorryRegret Possessions PessimismShame Desire SuperstitionRage Isolation WishingSelf-loathing Criticism Withholding If you feel as though what you think and believe are out of your control, or that your values were imposed on you, or that nothing good will ever happen again, then we will have to respectfully disagree. You’ve ask a very deep and insightful question, proving that your hope has gotten you this far. Hang onto that hope because I’m an example of things working out despite my previous way of looking at my life.Instead of “convincing” yourself that you’re okay when you’re not, how about calling it “accepting yourself as okay just the way you are, without judging your okayness.” You probably have high standards (perfectionism?) and that’s a thing to talk with a counselor about. The opposite of perfect is not horrible. It’s called “good enough.”Blocking out the bad things and forgetting is as natural as eating and sleeping. All the other mammals do it (except when it comes to life-threatening bad things) so why shouldn’t we? This might be called optimism. Feeling alone and uncared for is a worse feeling than being despised. This is good! This means (I suppose) that you don’t despise yourself as much as you just don’t care for you (because we can often project our own self-beliefs onto others). This is an abstract concept that will take some time to get used to. But I have a suspicion that, with just a little more self-care, and a little more caring for others, you might be better off very soon.",

        "text": "Hi Cerritos,This is an interesting twist because it's more common for the person in your position to want to move forward, and for the person who was wronged to struggle with forgiveness. You are lucky to have a loving, compassionate partner, and your boyfriend is lucky to have a partner who takes full responsibility for their actions. My hunch is that you learned some things about yourself when you were younger that are playing a role here. Your sense of worthlessness seems out of proportion to the mistakes you made. You don't have to be perfect in order to deserve the love of a good man. You only have to have the maturity to recognise when you've hurt someone and work hard to make it better. Who in your life overreacted to small mistakes you made? Were you shamed as a child? Did you learn that you deserved to be punished? Did something bad happen that you thought was your fault? Is there a mistake you made long ago that you need forgiveness for? There is a younger person inside you waiting to be forgiven for something they weren't entirely responsible for. The bar is too high for you. If I was your therapist, I would work with you to find the source of the shame, and address that wound. If you want to move forward and be with your boyfriend, your job will be to forgive yourself. Forgiving doesn't mean \"it was okay\"; forgiving simply means that it happened, that you can't erase it, and that you don't want to carry it around or punish yourself for it anymore. You have done many things here that you can feel proud of! You've 'come clean', you've been honest, you've taken responsibility for your actions, you've not tried to minimize what you did, and you've chosen to be more loyal and aware of how you impact your boyfriend. These are all things you can use to build your sense of worth. You are acting very honourably. It's time to put your past mistakes away on the shelf knowing that you've learned from them and are a better person now. It's not our mistakes...not our worst moments that define us...it's how we handle them afterwards.I wish you growth and happiness.",

        "text": "It's understandable to feel overwhelmed by guilt and unworthiness, especially after experiencing conflicts and breaches of trust in your relationship. Here are some thoughts that might help you navigate through these feelings and work towards healing: 1. **Acknowledge Your Feelings**: It's important to allow yourself to feel the guilt and acknowledge it, but also recognize that these feelings are not necessarily indicative of your worth. Understand that everyone makes mistakes and that growth often comes from learning from them. 2. **Understand His Perspective**: Your boyfriend's decision to forgive you could stem from a deep love and commitment to the relationship. He may see the value in the relationship you both have built over the years and believe that your connection is worth fighting for. 3. **Communicate Openly**: Have an open conversation with your boyfriend about how you’re feeling. Sharing your feelings of guilt and unworthiness can help him understand what you're going through and strengthen your emotional connection. It's also an opportunity to discuss how both of you envision your future together and ways to rebuild trust. 4. **Focus on Growth**: Reflect on what you've learned from these experiences. How have they changed your outlook on relationships? What positive changes have you made since then? Focusing on personal growth can help you feel more positive about yourself and the relationship. 5. **Seek Professional Help**: Sometimes, talking to a therapist or counselor can provide an external perspective and help you work through feelings of guilt and self-worth. They can also offer strategies for repairing your relationship. 6. **Rebuild Trust**: Take tangible steps to rebuild trust with your boyfriend. This could involve being more transparent about your social interactions, ensuring open communication, and demonstrating a commitment to the relationship. 7. **Practice Self-Compassion**: Be kind to yourself. Remind yourself that it’s okay to be imperfect and that forgiveness, both from others and yourself, is a process. Engage in self-care activities and surround yourself with supportive friends and family. 8. **Create Shared Goals**: Work together with your boyfriend to set shared goals for your relationship, focusing on what you both want for the future. This can help re-establish a sense of unity and purpose. Healing takes time, and it’s perfectly okay to seek support as you work through these feelings. Remember, relationships can be complex, and the path to forgiveness and healing often involves ups and downs. Be patient with yourself and your partner as you navigate this process together.",

All these emotions are part of the healing process.

Understanding the roots of your low self-esteem can be a crucial step in breaking the cycle of unhealthy patterns. 3. **Set Boundaries**: If checking your ex-boyfriend's social media is causing you distress, it might be helpful to take a break from it. You can mute or unfollow him for a while. Focusing on your own life and progress can help reduce the emotional turmoil. 4. **Forgiveness, for Yourself**: Forgiveness doesn’t mean condoning what he did; it’s more about freeing yourself from the weight of anger and betrayal. You deserve to move forward and create space for healing. Think of forgiveness as a gift you give yourself, not him. 5. **Seek Support**: Talking to a therapist or a counselor can provide you with tools to process your feelings and gain perspective.

Building your self-esteem and self-worth independently can help you gain a stronger sense of who you are outside of your relationships. 7. **Give Yourself Time**: Healing takes time, and it’s okay if you’re not over things just yet. Be gentle with yourself and acknowledge that it’s a process. Patience is key. 8. **Consider New Relationships Cautiously**: While it’s great that you want to focus on a new relationship, ensure that you are not bringing unresolved issues into it. Take time to heal before diving into something new. Dealing with the aftermath of betrayal, especially with your background and experiences, can be extremely difficult.

This can help you feel more secure in yourself, whether you're in a relationship or not. Ultimately, you want to ensure that both you and your partner are in a healthy, supportive relationship. If you believe that he's better off without you, it might be worth exploring those feelings further—sometimes, the best decision for both individuals is to part ways.",

        "text": "Hi Michigan, Good for you for recognising a destructive pattern. This behaviour, although it might get you the attention you want initially, will ultimately drive men away because it's not respectful of them. My gut says that you learned early on in life that your value is in your sexuality alone. That's a powerful thought. You are certainly acting as if this is true. If you believed in your value as a person, you would be less afraid of deeper relationships and intimacy in general. If I were your therapist, I'd have many questions for you and I would need to understand a lot of things about you and your past to help you sort out where this idea about yourself came from. I'd suggest reaching out to a qualified therapist who can help you get to the root of this behaviour. Good luck!",

From just your personal experience alone you might realize how easy it may seem to keep such a secret from those around you. In the same way, there are many people who struggle secretly with this problem and not many people know or even notice. So you are definitely not alone. Low self-esteem or lack of confidence in some areas are issues that EVERY teen, in fact EVERY person, has experienced at some point. These feelings are \"normal.\" It sounds, though, as if these feelings of insecurity and inadequacy have begun to consume your every day thoughts and behaviors bringing you to where you are today - comparing yourself to others, purging, and feeling extreme guilt. Sometimes it's best if we seek outside help, instead of trying to tackle problems on our own. Breaking habits that come along with an eating disorder really requires the help of a doctor, nutritionist, and a therapist who can help change your perspective from the inside out!

It’s important to know that many teenagers experience similar feelings of insecurity and pressure, and it’s completely normal to struggle with such emotions during this phase of life. The pressure to fit in, look a certain way, and perform well can be overwhelming, and it can create a lot of self-doubt.

If you’re feeling overwhelmed, you might find it helpful to talk to someone who can provide support, such as a trusted friend, family member, or mental health professional. They can help you navigate these feelings and find healthier coping strategies. You deserve to feel good about yourself just as you are.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot of pain and uncertainty following your breakup, and it's completely understandable to feel the way you do given what you've experienced.

Building confidence in social situations, particularly when it comes to approaching someone you're interested in, can be challenging for many people. Here are some tips that might help you feel more confident when approaching girls: 1. **Shift Your Mindset:** Focus on the idea that approaching someone is an opportunity to get to know them rather than a high-stakes situation. Remember that it's just a conversation. 2. **Practice Social Skills:** Engage in casual conversations with people in low-pressure situations—friends, acquaintances, or even strangers. This can help you feel more comfortable and fluent in social interactions. 3. **Set Small Goals:** Start by setting achievable goals, such as making eye contact or smiling at someone, before progressing to initiating a conversation. This gradual approach can boost your confidence. 4. **Prepare Topics:** Think of a few conversation starters or questions in advance. Topics can be as simple as asking about their interests, sharing a funny story, or commenting on your surroundings. 5. **Be Yourself:** Authenticity can be attractive. Instead of trying to be someone you're not, embrace your personality and interests. People appreciate genuineness. 6. **Manage Rejection:** Understand that not every approach will lead to a positive response, and that's okay. Rejection is a part of life, and each experience can be a learning opportunity. 7. **Focus on Common Interests:** Look for shared interests or mutual friends that can serve as natural conversation starters and make the interaction feel more comfortable. 8. **Body Language:** Pay attention to your body language. Stand tall, make eye contact, and smile—this not only makes you appear more approachable but can also influence how you feel about yourself. 9. **Visualize Success:** Take a moment to visualize a successful interaction before approaching someone. This can help reduce anxiety and encourage a positive mindset. 10. **Be Patient:** Building confidence takes time. Keep putting yourself out there, and over time, approaching girls will likely become easier. Remember that confidence is a skill that can be developed, and everyone's journey is different.

Allow yourself to feel what you feel and know that moving on is a gradual process. Remember, it's okay to seek help and take your time. Everyone moves on at their own pace, and prioritizing your well-being is the key.",

        "text": "Well, there is some good news and not-so-good news. The good news is that people are capable of moving on from relationships, even if the person showed them a sort of love that they've never felt they've had, or deserved, before. Sometimes, even just the fact that this has happened for them can, eventually (see below) lead them to seek out love again, because they now believe they will be able to have that again.So, the not-so-good news though is that one can not \"just move on.\" I'd even venture to say that the pressure you may be putting on yourself to just move on and out of this yucky hole of feelings that you are in is actually too much pressure and adding to the yucky feelings as they are. Instead, try thinking of getting past these feelings as grieving over the loss of someone (even though someone didn't die, there is still a significant loss you are experiencing) and therefore how essential it is to allow yourself to grieve, to feel whatever feelings (of anger, or sadness, or something else) that you are feeling. Often, it is really helpful to speak those feelings (I recommend professionals in this case) who can help you feel like you are not pathological for this struggle, and instead that it is completely normal. Love is a crazy thing, and the feelings can get very confusing. But, the last stage of grieving is \"acceptance,\" and it is very challenging to get there if you skip over denial, anger, bargaining, and depression.",

        "text": "Moving on from someone you love can be incredibly challenging, especially if the feelings were intense and meaningful. Here are some strategies to help you navigate this difficult process: 1. **Allow Yourself to Grieve**: It's essential to acknowledge and accept your feelings. Allow yourself to grieve the relationship and the love you experienced. Recognize that it’s valid to feel sad or lost without that connection. 2. **Limit Contact**: If possible, establish some distance from the person. This can help you create the emotional space needed to heal and gain perspective on your feelings. 3. **Reflect on the Relationship**: Take some time to write down your thoughts about the relationship. Consider both the positive and the negative aspects. This can help you see the situation more clearly and may aid in processing your emotions. 4. **Focus on Yourself**: Engage in self-care and activities that bring you joy and fulfillment. Consider pursuing hobbies, spending time with friends, or focusing on personal goals. Invest in your own well-being and happiness. 5. **Challenge Romanticized Thoughts**: It's common to idealize past relationships. Remind yourself of the reasons why moving on is the best choice for you. Focus on the reality of the situation rather than the fantasy of what was or what could have been. 6. **Talk to Yourself Like a Friend**: Approach your feelings with kindness and compassion. Imagine you're comforting a friend going through the same situation—what would you say to them? 7. **Create New Memories**: Try to cultivate new experiences that can replace the memories associated with this person. This could involve trying new activities, meeting new people, or exploring new places. 8. **Seek Professional Support**: If you’re feeling overwhelmed, consider talking to a therapist or counselor. They can provide a safe space to express your feelings and help you work through them. 9. **Set Future Goals**: Focus on what you want for your future. Setting goals can help shift your perspective towards hope and excitement about what lies ahead. 10. **Practice Forgiveness**: This might mean forgiving yourself for feeling the way you do or forgiving the person for whatever circumstances have made the relationship difficult. Letting go of resentment can be liberating. Remember, healing takes time, and it’s okay to feel conflicted. Allow yourself to experience your emotions without judgment, and know that with time and effort, it will become easier to move forward.",

Breaking off an engagement is a significant life change, and learning about the cheating must have added even more pain and confusion. It’s completely normal to think about someone who played such a significant role in your life, especially when emotions are still fresh. Here are a few things you might consider: 1. **Reflect on Your Feelings**: Take some time to process your feelings about the relationship, the breakup, and the communication since. Understanding your emotions can help you determine what you truly want moving forward. 2. **Evaluate Communication**: You mentioned that you’ve been communicating on and off. Think about what this communication means to you and whether it’s helping you heal or keeping you stuck in a cycle of confusion. Sometimes, stepping back from contact can provide clarity. 3. **Talk to Someone**: Whether it’s a trusted friend, family member, or a counselor, sharing your feelings with someone who can offer support can be incredibly beneficial. It might also help you feel less alone in this situation. 4. **Focus on Yourself**: Engaging in activities that nourish your well-being can be helpful. Whether it's focusing on your college studies, engaging in hobbies, or spending time with friends, these activities can provide a positive distraction and help you regain a sense of self. 5. **Consider Closure**: If you’re struggling to move on, consider whether you need closure from this relationship, whether it’s through a final conversation or simply accepting that it's time to move forward. Remember, it’s okay to prioritize your own emotional health and well-being at this time. Take it one day at a time, and give yourself grace as you navigate your feelings.",

        "text": "I'm sorry to hear that you're going through such a difficult situation. It sounds incredibly challenging, and it's understandable to feel confused by your spouse's behavior. When someone has borderline personality disorder (BPD) and narcissistic traits, their emotional responses and behavior can be quite intense and sometimes contradictory. Here are a few possible explanations for the behaviors you're describing: 1. **Fear of Abandonment**: Individuals with BPD often have a deep-seated fear of abandonment. Even if they express strong negative feelings towards a partner, they may simultaneously fear losing that connection, leading to jealousy when they perceive that their partner is interacting with someone else. 2. **Splitting**: A common behavior in BPD is “splitting,” where individuals view situations or people in extremes—either all good or all bad. This can lead to fluctuating feelings toward you, where he might express love and then later contempt. You may appear to him as someone he needs to push away, yet he may still have a need for your presence. 3. **Projection**: It's also possible that he is projecting his feelings onto you. If he feels emotionally disconnected or feels guilt about wanting to be with other women, he may accuse you of having no feelings for him, reflecting his own fears and insecurities. 4. **Narcissistic Traits**: If he has narcissistic tendencies, he may seek to maintain control over you while simultaneously seeking validation from others. Jealousy can stem from insecurity and a desire to dominate the emotional landscape of the relationship, even if he expresses disdain for you. 5. **Inability to Regulate Emotions**: Both BPD and narcissistic traits can contribute to difficulties in regulating emotions. This may manifest as a volatile emotional state, leading to moments of intense feeling that can confuse both him and you. 6. **Conflict Avoidance**: He may express a desire for separation but also struggle with the implications of it. Mixed signals can arise from his internal conflict about the desire for freedom while still being tied to you. In situations like this, it can be helpful to seek support from a mental health professional or a support group. Setting boundaries for your own well-being is important, and considering counseling for yourself can provide you with tools to navigate this complex relationship. Remember that you deserve to be in a relationship where you feel valued and respected.",

        "text": "It's not uncommon for relationships to go cold over time. It is a matter of one or the other becoming complacent. If you and your husband have been together for quite some time it's likely that you are very comfortable and familiar with each other. While this is a good thing in some ways, it can also become boring and you run the risk of losing that \"in love\" feeling he is referring to. Couples simply become ambivalent. For some of the couples I work with in my practice, I find that helping to organize a time apart, which I call a \"Therapeutic Separation\" can do wonders for the relationship. I offer homework to be done during this time. Reading, worksheets and individual counseling helps people learn more about themselves and what they desire out of their relationship. It often times brings more appreciation for their partners. When the pair comes back together, we are able to push the reset button and begin a new chapter that is more fulfilling and exciting than before.",

Here are some considerations to help you think through your options: 1. **Communication**: Have open and honest conversations with your husband about what he needs during this time and how you feel. Understanding each other's perspectives can provide clarity. 2. **Self-Reflection**: Take time to reflect on your own feelings and needs. Consider what you want for your future and whether reconciliation is worth the wait for you. 3. **Time Apart**: Sometimes, a period of separation can help both parties gain perspective. However, it’s essential to establish boundaries during this time to avoid confusion. 4. **Counseling**: Couples therapy could be beneficial, even during a separation. A neutral third party can help facilitate healthier communication and address underlying issues. 5. **Support System**: Lean on friends or family for support. They can provide different viewpoints and help you process your feelings. 6. **Future Goals**: Think about what you envision for your future. Are you open to starting over if things don’t work out, or do you see a future with your husband? 7. **Move at Your Own Pace**: Ultimately, it’s crucial to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. If waiting feels unhealthy or burdensome, consider exploring new opportunities. Regardless of the decision you make, ensure that it aligns with your values and well-being.

Here are some strategies you can consider to help you cultivate healthier relationships and build a more secure emotional foundation: 1. **Self-Reflection**: Take time to understand why you gravitate towards unavailable partners. Consider journaling your thoughts and feelings to uncover patterns in your relationships. Reflection can help you identify triggers and underlying fears that influence your choices. 2. **Set Boundaries**: Learn to establish and communicate your boundaries clearly. Practice saying \"no\" when a situation feels uncomfortable. This can help you regain control over your interactions and reduce the likelihood of emotional abuse. 3. **Develop Self-Esteem**: Work on building your self-worth independent of others. Engage in activities that make you feel good about yourself and focus on your strengths. Surround yourself with supportive friends and family who reinforce your value. 4. **Therapy or Counseling**: Consider seeking professional help to work through your feelings of insecurity and attachment. A therapist can help you understand your behaviors, develop healthier coping strategies, and create a plan for change. 5. **Explore Interests and Hobbies**: Find activities that you enjoy doing alone. This can help you become more comfortable with solitude and build self-reliance. Engage in hobbies, pursue new interests, and develop skills that are fulfilling. 6. **Challenge Negative Thoughts**: Replace negative beliefs about yourself and relationships with positive affirmations. For example, remind yourself that you deserve a loving, respectful relationship. Question the narrative that you need someone else to be whole. 7. **Build a Support Network**: Nurture relationships with friends and family who are uplifting. Reach out to them for support instead of seeking validation solely from romantic partners. 8. **Take Small Steps**: Gradually practice being alone or doing things independently. Start with short periods and increase as you become more comfortable. This can help you reduce dependency on others for your happiness. 9. **Educate Yourself**: Read books or attend workshops that focus on healthy relationships, emotional health, and personal development. Understanding the dynamics of relationships can empower you to make better choices. 10. **Be Patient with Yourself**: Change takes time and effort. Celebrate your progress, no matter how small, and acknowledge the challenges as part of your growth journey. Ultimately, you deserve a relationship built on mutual respect and genuine connection. By understanding your patterns and taking proactive steps, you can create a path towards healthier connections and greater emotional well-being.",
